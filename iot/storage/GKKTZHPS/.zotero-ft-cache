Bluetooth
- Known as IEEE 802.15.1 base on Ericson research - Low power consumption (15ma for transmit, 1uA for sleep)
- Coin cell battery for energy supply
- Exchange small packets (opposed to streaming) - Connect → Transmit → Disconnect → Sleep - GFSK Modulation - Only up to 1 Mbps, 2 and 3 Mbps - 2,4 GHz, ISM band, 40 channels
- 3 Advertising channels - 37 Data channels - Adaptive Frequency Hopping - 24 bits for CRC - Output power → 10 mW (10 dBm)

Bluetooth (Master/Slave actions)

Across platform, Bluetooth is not easy to remember

Once a device has been slaved, (paired) Only the master can set it free. Users tend to forget which device it was paired with.

The three Bluetooth output power classes up to Bluetooth 2.0

Bluetooth (Master/Slave actions)
State Machine The operation of the Link Layer can be described in terms of a state machine with the following five states:
Master - Can have multiple slaves - Determines when slaves listen - Determines frequency hopping algorithm - Sends connection determination at connection request, but can update parameters
after connection - If received packet from slave, no need to respond
Slave - Only one master - If received packed from master, must respond

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
RFCOMM : Radio Frequency Communication is a reliable stream-based protocol as TCP. It emulates RS-232. L2CAP : Logical Link Control And Adaption Protocol. Packet based protocol with varying levels of reliability. 672 bytes< Packet size < 65,535 bytes SCO: (Synchronous Connection Oriented) Best effort packet based protocol used to transmit voice 64 kb/s
HCI Host Controler Interface It defines how a computer interacts and communicates with a local Bluetooth controler

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

SPP: Serial Port Profile. It replaces the existing RS-232 with payload capacity equal to 128 bytes. SMP : Security manager Protocol. It is role is to establish pairing, authentication and encryption between devices. ATT: Attribute protocol. It defines the procedures and formats of services and their characteristics.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

GATT: Generic Attribute Profile manages different types of profile. BLE it manages the devices connections to one central device. GAP Generic Access Profile. It is what makes your device visible to the outside world, and determines how two devices can (or can't) interact with each other.

SigFox - LPWAN

How to communicate
1) Detect Something to send ( the hard step) 2) Power on the communication module 3) Send 4) Message is picked up by the network 5) Data is received on your server
Proprieties : - Send an AT command (couple of code) Up to 12 bytes - Receive an HTTP request on a application server - Unlicensed frequency band (868 MHz) - Maximise energy efficiency (Tx in two seconds, 25mW: 14dBm) - In theory, base stations cover up to 200 km. In reality, it depends on topography
(in a city like Paris, coverage not exceed 5 km)

28

SigFox - LPWAN

Proprieties : - 7 messages/ hour with 100 bits/s - No ACK messages - Example of payload
- GPS coordinates (lat x lng) : 6 bytes - Temperature : 2 bytes - State reporting: 1 byte - Messages are signed with a key unique to the device - Messages are scrambled or encrypted - No keys exchanged over the network

How to prototype ? - Arduino, Rasberry PI, Atmel etc
Easy to start but not industrial.
