◮ We consider a LoRaWAN network with N end-devices and one gateway
◮ One spreading factor s and one sub-channel are available ◮ Transmit attempts are done according to a Poisson distribution ◮ All end-devices have the same packet generation rate λ(s) ◮ All packets have the same length of l bytes
◮ The normalized throughput of the LoRaWAN network is:

S = G exp(−2G ) = Nλ(s)Ta(l, s) exp(−2Nλ(s)Ta(l, s))

Centralized Resource Management Problem

◮ We suppose that we have an external traﬃc (e.g. devices belonging to a diﬀerent operator) of intensity λes packets per second on spreading factor s.

◮ Let ps be the ratio of devices using SF s.

◮ We can write the normalized channel traﬃc on SF s as

follows:

Distributed resource management Problem

LoRaWAN

Reinforcement learning based algorithms are lightweight and particularly adapted to LoRaWAN
◮ Any end-device is an intelligent agent that chooses a convenient spreading factor SFi or strategy s = {SFi }.
◮ Let S = {7, . . . , 12} be the set of spreading factors.
◮ Realistic setting: devices are unaware of their position and channel conditions.
◮ At each iteration t (at packet arrival), any device selects a strategy s(t) which renders a reward rs (t) ∈ {0, 1}. ◮ Successful packet transmission (acknowledged by the GW) yields rs (t) = 1. ◮ In case of packet loss, rs (t) = 0.

Distributed resource management Problem: MAB

◮ Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem makes use of local information available at the LoRaWAN end-device level (received ACK).
◮ The result of the devised algorithm in each device will be a set of SFs that suﬀers the least from collisions.
◮ To reduce the resource occupation of the neighboring devices, each device follows a set of rules to strike a good balance between:
◮ (i) Exploiting the cumulated knowledge by choosing the most appropriate SF s to transmit, and
◮ (ii) Exploring other SFs that could be interesting to exploit.

Which MAB?

LoRaWAN

There are two widely considered MAB types 1:
◮ For stochastic MAB, the reward of each strategy is drawn according to a given probability density function (PDF)
◮ For non-stochastic MAB, no statistical assumptions are made about the generation of rewards.
As the distributed selection of the best radio resources by uncoordinated devices is appropriately modeled by the adversarial MAB problem, we resort to the popular EXP3 algorithm (Exponential Weights for Exploration and Exploitation) 2.
