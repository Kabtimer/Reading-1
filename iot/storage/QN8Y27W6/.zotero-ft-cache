ABSTRACT
High throughput wireless access networks such as IEEE 802.11ac show a signi cant challenge in choosing link con guration parameters dynamically based on channel condition. It is due to a large pool of design set like channel bonding, number of spatial streams, guard intervals, di erent modulation and coding schemes, frame aggregation etc. Selection of such parameters is far challenging in mobile environment where signal strength uctuates frequently. In this paper, we design a so ware-de ned networking (SDN) framework for link adaptation in mobile environment, that engages an adaptive learning-based methodology, ϵ − reed policy.
e proposed link adaptation mechanism, Linkcon, explores several possible con guration options on the basis of their impact on network performance in various channel conditions. We analyze the performance of Linkcon from simulation results. We observe that this approach provides a signi cant be er performance compared to other competing schemes proposed in the literature.

1 INTRODUCTION
High throughput amendments of IEEE 802.11 are introduced in the last few years to ful ll the demand of high data rate in wireless local area networks (WLANs). IEEE 802.11n and IEEE 802.11ac [18] are examples in this direction, and they are popularly termed as High roughput WLANs (HT-WLANs). Both physical (PHY) layer

and medium access control (MAC) sublayer of IEEE 802.11n/ac are enhanced with some new features for improving the capacity of the wireless transmissions, whereas maintaining the compatibility with legacy IEEE 802.11 standards. Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antenna technology, channel bonding, short guard interval (SGI) and advanced modulation and coding scheme (MCS) are the enhanced features in PHY. MIMO can increase transmission range and data rate by applying multiple antennas. MCS is used to regulate the coding rate and modulation of a signal with the combination of MIMO spatial streams. By using channel bonding feature, multiple channels of 20 MHz can be combined together to create 20/40/80/160 MHz channels. Physical data rate is increased theoretically by applying this enhancement. In contrast to the standard guard interval of 800ns, SGI supports guard interval of 400 ns. Similarly, MAC sublayer is enhanced with frame aggregation and block acknowledgement (BACK) technologies.
Although HT-WLANs support several advanced features at both PHY and MAC layers, each feature comes with its internal tradeo s in performance under diverse channel conditions. While every feature shows a remarkable performance in a speci c network condition, it fails in other network conditions. For example, communication with higher channel width can not sustain under weak signal strength. Consequently, wider channels are prone to increased packet losses due to external interferences and channel errors [4, 5]. MIMO throws the challenge of placing multiple antennas and design of transmi er modules for e cient communication over time varying wireless channels [22]. For high network tra c and congestion in a network, SGI may drop the overall system throughput, as inter-symbol interference may not get eliminated with 400ns guard interval under a congested network scenario. Signal fading, channel interference and signal a enuation impose a signi cant uctuation in signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the wireless channel. High SNR is needed for sustaining of higher MCS values [20]. In case of MAC enhancements, frame aggregation transmits multiple frames in a single transmission. us, this feature increases packet loss for low signal level and high channel error conditions [10]. By carrying multiple acknowledgements, BACK induces high packet loss when signal strength is low [15].
Link adaptation: Considering aforesaid trade-o s, an important design objective is to transmit the data at the best suited PHY and MAC parameters for the present channel condition. A xed set of PHY and MAC parameters can not be the optimal under all circumstances since a wireless network is a time-varying system. erefore, it is necessary to select PHY and MAC parameters dynamically to cope up with channel condition. Considering the current channel condition, the selection of the best possible set of

link parameters is known as link adaptation which is addressed in this paper.
Impact of mobility: Most of the existing mechanisms of link or rate adaptation in IEEE 802.11, such as [8, 12, 19] and the references therein, are based on static environments. In a mobile scenario, interference, signal fading and a enuation change signi cantly in di erent positions of a wireless station. Hence, a wireless device observes contrasting channel conditions repeatedly. Consequently, the link adaptation is far challenging since a selected link con guration at time t needs to be revised at time t + 1. Further, dynamic link adaptation in HT-WLANs is very di cult under mobile environment because of a large number of PHY/MAC parameter sets with their inter-dependencies.
Contribution of this Paper: In this paper, we explore automatic learning by wireless devices from the past knowledge, such that they can select the best suited link parameters adaptively when a change in channel condition is observed. We develop a so ware controlled architecture based on the concept of so ware de ned networking (SDN) paradigm [9, 14], where a network controller connected with the wireless access points captures the link state con gurations and decides optimal link parameters based on an online learning mechanism. We rst design an optimization mechanism to select the optimal link con gurations based on the underlying channel conditions. However, as it is di cult to learn the channel condition in a distributed environment, we employ the SDN controller to periodically collect channel conditions and apply a distributed online automatic learning mechanism to learn the impact of channel conditions over various link parameters. We apply ϵ-greedy [21] policy as an adaptive machine learning approach to design an e cient dynamic link adaptation mechanism, Linkcon, for HT-WLANs. e SDN control for Linkcon provides programmability support to the network administrator and makes the functionality easier by maintaining a global view of the whole network. Additionally, SDN simpli es the design of Linkcon since SDN controllers are vendor-neutral and open standards-based. We consider channel bonding, MIMO streams, MCS, SGI and frame aggregation to create the set of link parameters. SNR is engaged as the measurement of channel condition. We employ packet error rate (PER) to measure overall performance of network. e performance of Linkcon is analyzed through simulation results. e analysis shows that this mechanism improves the network performance signi cantly compared to other related schemes explored in the literature.
2 RELATED WORKS
In HT-WLANs, dynamic link adaptation can be classi ed into two categories as follows. (i) Link adaptation in static environment: MiRA [17] is a dynamic data rate adaptation approach that selects spatial streams and rates. It is based on MIMO technology and the receiver’s feedback. In poor channel condition, MiRA performs excessive rate selection. Further, RAMAS [16] is a credit-based scheme that also applies MIMO streams. So, this approach incurs overhead of assigning credit to select data rate. Deek et al. [4] proposed a rate adaptation scheme based on channel bonding. But, the mechanism can not utilize the full strength of all PHY/MAC new features. Minstrel [2] is

the default link adaptation algorithm in Linux system and engages the statistical information for channel overhearing. However, it is suitable only for legacy IEEE 802.11 systems. Di erent MCS values and MIMO are used in [23, 24]. Feng et al. [6] developed a link adaptation scheme that applies frame aggregation. All these mechanisms do not consider all PHY/MAC enhancements of HT-WLANs along with their internal trade-o s. us, these approaches are not able to meet theoretical achievable data rate of IEEE 802.11n/ac in practical scenarios.
Minstrel HT [7] is the default rate adaptation methodology that is applied by the wireless driver ath9k [1]. It perceives the maximum enhancements of PHY/MAC in IEEE 802.11n, but su ers from exhaustive sampling. SampleLite [13] is a pure received signal strength indicator (RSSI) threshold-based algorithm. It can not cope up with all possible wireless network scenarios. In one of our previous works [11], a dynamic link adaptation scheme is designed for IEEE 802.11n. In this work, we consider a limited set of channel conditions measured by RSSI. In our another work [12], an adaptive learner is designed for link adaptation in IEEE 802.11ac. Sur et al. [19] designed MUSE that is a MU-MIMO-based rate adaptation algorithm for IEEE 802.11ac networks. ESNR is an another rate selection scheme designed in [8]. Speci cally, it was designed for IEEE 802.11n (MIMO). All new features of HT-WLANs are not employed in MUSE and ESNR. Moreover, their performances were not evaluated in mobile environment. (ii) Link adaptation in mobile environment: As per our knowledge, no work has yet considered SDN-based framework to design a dynamic link adaptation algorithm for HT-WLANs in mobile environment. However, Chen et al. [3] proposed a rate adaptation algorithm, RAM, for mobile environment considering only legacy IEEE 802.11 standards. Hence, it is not adjustable with HT-WLANs.
3 LINKCON: SYSTEM MODEL AND DESIGN
DETAILS
Linkcon is based on the concept of SDN architecture. erefore, we separate the control of the entire network from the underlying hardware systems. e details of the architecture are given as follows.
3.1 SDN-based Linkcon Architecture
Linkcon has a hierarchical architecture containing two leyers – layer-1 and layer-2. In layer-1, a central SDN controller (CSC) is placed. SDN controller for initial experience phase (SCI) and SDN controller for experience phase (SCE) are placed in layer-2.
e details of these two phases are given in Section 3.8. Figure 1 illustrates this architecture.
CSC is installed in a single centralized system. Whereas, SCI and SCE have more than one instance and they form a complete SDN controller in layer-2. us, SCI and SCE are implemented in several systems. ey run simultaneously and control di erent disjoint sets of access points in distributed way. e major functionalities of the proposed framework are shown in Figure 2. As our proposed model follows SDN framework, there are three layers in this model – application, control and infrastructure.
CSC divides the number of available access points (APs) in the controllers of layer-2 (SCI and SCE). For example, if we have n

3.2 Policy Generation for Setting Link

Parameters

Policy generator for se ing the values of di erent link parameters

resides in the sub-module – con guration se ing rule. We formulate

an optimization problem where we try to minimize a utility function.

While a station (STA) connects to an AP, a tra c ow is maintained

by that AP on the behalf of the STA. Hence, we represent the

number of STAs by the number of ows controlled by APs. Let us

consider pi denotes the PER of ow i. In our proposed mechanism,

we consider channel bonding, MIMO streams, guard interval, frame

aggregation and MCS to construct the link con guration set that

will control data transmission. Let ci , si , i , ai and mi be the values

of channel bandwidth, number of MIMO spatial streams, guard

interval, level of frame aggregation and MCS value for ith ow. ci

ranges from minBand to maxBand, and si varies from minStream

to maxStream. i can be either minGi (400 ns) or maxGi (800 ns).

e level of frame aggregation varies from minLe el to maxLe el,

where we include four levels of frame aggregation. mi varies from

minMcs to maxMcs. Each of these con guration parameters (ci , si ,

i , ai and mi ) is normalized by a sigmoid function. For variable t,

sigmoid function is de

ned as f (t ) =

1 1+e −t

.

Any so real-time tra c has a saturation point, but since such

tra c has exible delay tolerance, their utility graph is concave in

nature. Without much loss of generality, we can assume that so

real-time tra c has logarithmic utility pa ern. As tra c increases,

PER in the network also increases and thus, our aim should be to

minimize PER of the network. At the same time, we must try to

increase the values of the con guration parameters to obtain a high

throughput. Let zi denote the sum of the normalized values of four

con guration parameters of ow i. Hence, zi can be represented as

follows.

zi = f (ci ) + f (si ) + f ( i ) + f (ai ) + f (mi )

Here, f (ci ), f (si ), f ( i ), f (ai ) and f (mi ) represent normalized values of ci , si , i , ai and mi respectively. Moreover, assume xi is the normalized version of zi such that xi = f (zi ). In our approach, we consider PER and xi as the metric of tra c utility measurement.
us, our objective is to maximize xi and minimize pi . We de ne a

is problem is a variant of the popular bin-packing problem. In the traditional bin-packing problem, the objective is to nd the minimum number of bins. If we consider each ow as a bin, we do not want to reduce the number of bins in our case. is is because reduction of the number of ows will reduce the total network utilization. us, we need to determine the maximum possible values of our four con guration parameters such that overall PER of network will be reduced. As bin-packing is a combinatorial NP-Hard problem, we had no choice but to use an approximate algorithm for the estimation of link parameters. Exploiting this feature of the proposed optimization framework, we apply ϵ-greedy policy [21] as an approximate algorithm to set the values of the con guration parameters.

3.3 Metric Selection
Linkcon uses two channel metrics for selecting link parameters – (i) SNR of the channel and (ii) PER; considering channel bonding, MIMO streams, SGI, frame aggregation and advanced MCS values. SNR is a good measurement of signal quality since it indicates an additive e ect from both interference noise and channel noise.

3.4 Model Description
In Linkcon, we consider channel bonding (c), MIMO spatial streams (s), SGI ( ), level of frame aggregation (a) and MCS (m). It can be represented by a tuple T < c, s, , a, m >. Level of channel bonding ranges from minBand to maxBand. s takes number of MIMO streams ranging from minStream to maxStream. is either 800 ns or 400 ns. Let us consider a has na values. If na = 1, the maximum number of aggregated frames is considered and it is maxLe el. is value is decremented by the value of dec in successive higher values of na i.e., minLe el = maxLe el − (na − 1) × dec. m ranges from minMcs to maxMcs. e value of c is changed as follows.

c = 2i × minBand, i = 0, 1, ..., maxIndex − 1

(7)

Here, minBand is selected when i = 0 and maxBand is chosen for i = maxIndex − 1.
Considering di erent values of T , a con guration set C is formed. Assume there are K number of con gurations in C and thus, we have |C | = K. Two phases are proposed in this scheme – con guration selection and data transmission. In the con guration selection phase, the best possible values of link parameters are chosen. A er that, data transmission begins for a time interval t. Let us consider L is the learner that applies ϵ-greedy policy to gain the knowledge about wireless environment. Based on the past experience, the learner takes decision in the selection phase. Hence, L performs the con guration selection phase and initiates data transmission. At the end of time t, L calculates PER and starts the next selection phase.

3.5 ϵ-greedy Policy
It is a well-known policy in machine learning [21]. A parameter ϵ, known as exploration probability, is used to control the learning rate. e policy enforcement employs two phases as follows. Exploration: In this phase, a con guration is selected randomly and the probability of this selection is ϵ. Exploitation: e con guration which has produced the best performance (in our case, it is PER) in the past is chosen in this case.
e probability of exploitation is (1 − ϵ ). ese two approaches can be combined as a Strategy. Hence, a Strategy is de ned as Strate = ϵ × Explore + (1 − ϵ ) × exploit.

3.6 SNR Estimation
To cope up with a mobile environment, at any time t of data rate estimation, we calculate the SNR value using exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA), as follows.

Sa (t ) = γ · Scur r (t ) + (1 − γ ) · Sa (t − 1)

(8)

In Eq. (8), Scurr (t ) is the present SNR value of the channel measured by L and Sa (t ) represents the value of the EWMA which is treated as the estimated value of the SNR at t for selecting the
data rate. Sa (t − 1) denotes the EWMA at (t − 1). Here γ is a parameter representing the degree of decrease of weightage, and
it lies between 0 and 1. At t, the deviation denoted by De (t ) is
calculated between Scurr (t ) and Sa (t − 1) as follows.

De (t ) = |Scur r (t ) − Sa (t − 1)|

3.7 Statistics Table
As a statistic-based learning approach is followed by Linkcon, a statistics table E is created and maintained by L. Let E =< S, C, P >, where S denotes the value of Sa and P is PER. Hence, E contains the past experience of data transmission.
3.8 Linkcon: Algorithm
Execution steps of Linkcon is presented in Algorithm 1. A detailed description of this algorithm is given in the following. (1) Initial experience phase (Step 2): is module is executed in the SCI instance of the SDN controller. L changes the value of c following Eqn.( 7). erefore, c is initially set to minBand and ends with maxBand. L measures EWMA SNR and selects the con gurations for the minimum and maximum value of MCS of each set < c, s, min, amax , m >. A er a time period tdur , PER is calculated and E is updated accordingly. In this context, min refers to SGI and amax speci es maxLe el level of a. Here, tdur should be chosen by the network administrator in such a way that the variation of channel condition (EWMA SNR) is least within that duration. In this way, the system is able to gather information about wireless environment for the best and the worst con gurations. is phase is executed periodically to obtain the experience of system performance for di erent channel conditions. (2) Experience phase (Step 3 - Step 19):
is module is executed in the SCE instance of the SDN controller. At the beginning of this phase, EWMA SNR is calculated, and let this value be x at time t. Based on the value of ϵ, L applies exploration and exploitation approaches. At time t, L calculates ϵt and searches for a value of SNR between (x −α ) and (x +α ) in E, for α > 0. If the search is successful, the con guration that has provided the lowest PER for this range is chosen with probability (1 − ϵt ). Otherwise, the learner selects the con guration in E with probability (1 − ϵt ). If x is not present in aforesaid range of SNR, a con guration is selected uniformly at random in C by applying probability of ϵt . By considering these two cases (exploitation and exploration), let the chosen con guration be . A er that, data transmission is initiated with the chosen con guration. At the end of transmission phase

4 PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
Linkcon has been implemented in network simulator (NS) version NS-3.25 and we analyze the performance through infrastructure IEEE 802.11ac WLAN. ere are multiple wireless STAs in the network. ey are contending for accessing channel and transmi ing data among themselves. Type of frame aggregation is A-MPDU. α, dec and r are set to 5.0, 10 and 1.0 respectively. e details of the simulation set-up are presented in Table 1. We compare the performance of Linkcon with respect to RAM [3], MUSE [19], ESNR [8], SampleLite [13] and Minstrel HT [7].
4.1 Analysis of roughput
Figure 3 demonstrates the performance of Linkcon with respect to average throughput. Consideration of EWMA SNR enables Linkcon more adjustable with abrupt change of signal strength. L makes Linkcon intelligent to cope up with channel condition. e exploration technique applied by L leads to the examination of the performance of unexplored con gurations. Exploration becomes valuable in highly congested network. When L applies di erent set of parameters in congested scenario, it gains knowledge about the performance of these sets. In the future, this experience helps to select the best suited con guration in a crowded environment. For selecting data rate, MUSE focuses on the selection of MU-MIMO antenna and ESNR applies MIMO technology. However, none of them consider the frequent change of signal quality in wireless environment. Similarly, SampleLite and MinstrelHT were mainly developed for static station. RAM deals with mobility, but it does not engage enhanced features of HT-WLANs. From Figure 3(b), Linkcon has a throughput of 1.7 and 12 times higher than that of MUSE and ESNR respectively in congested environment (20 stations). Whereas, the other competing schemes are lagging far behind of Linkcon.

con gurations. As time progresses, exploitation increases. As a consequence, the system becomes able to choose parameter set as per the signal level. Hence, packet loss is reduced (Figure 4(a)). Further, due to low PLR and the increase of average throughput, packet delay is reduced as demonstrated in Figure 4(b). From Figure 4(a), Linkcon has PLRs of 52.31% and 75.43% less than that of MUSE and ESNR respectively (20 stations).

4.3 Selection of Con guration
Selection of an appropriate con guration according to channel condition is the key issue for adapting with mobile environment. To analyze it, we examine which con gurations are being selected at di erent time instants by Linkcon, MUSE and SampleLite. In this case, we compute probability density functions (PDFs) of the parameters. Since RAM does not choose such con guration set, we do not include it in this analysis. Since ESNR uses MIMO technology, we consider EWMA SNR in evaluating the selection of MIMO antennas.

Figure 6: (a) Performance of Linkcon in selecting MIMO an-
tennas; (b) Fairness comparison
Linkcon: L gains experience about mobile environment and it always tries to apply the highest possible values of these parameters. During exploration, L gains knowledge about the performance of con gurations. On the basis of it, Linkcon tries to adjust with network condition by exploiting the maximum possible values of these parameters. As a result, probabilities of using the maximum values of these features are higher in Linkcon than the other schemes shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6(a). MUSE and SampleLite: Due to the lack of intelligent learning, MUSE can not cope up with mobile environment. us, it applies all PHY rates, channel bandwidths and MIMO streams with an average probability distribution as shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6(a). Since SampleLite was designed for IEEE 802.11n, all MCS values and channel bandwidths of IEEE 802.11ac are not used by this scheme. SampleLite can not cope up with variation of SNR values because its threshold-based scheme does not t in all network scenarios.
erefore, from Figure 5 and Figure 6(a) Linkcon outperforms others. In Linkcon, PDFs at MCS 9 and channel bandwidth 160 MHz are 1.41 and 1.29 times higher than that of MUSE, respectively (Figure 5). As shown in Figure 6(a), Linkcon applies 3 MIMO streams 1.12 times more than that of MUSE.

4.4 Fairness comparison
A comparative analysis of Jain’s fairness indices of throughputs of all competing mechanisms is presented in Figure 6(b). Linkcon also provides be er fairness than other schemes. In a congested network, a er some runs, L nds parameter sets which have the best performance so far. Considering the past information about the congested scenario along with EWMA SNR, Linkcon improves the fairness in a network.

5 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTION
Linkcon applies a machine learning policy, ϵ-greedy to select the best possible link parameter set for transmi ing data. We design a SDN architecture that executes our proposed mechanism. In the SDN framework, SCI and SCE run as a single unit in multiple systems in a distributed way. e distributed nature of the proposed SDN framework enable Linkcon to run for multiple wireless stations simultaneously. Moreover, the centralized module helps to provide a global view of the entire network. In mobile environment, due to the rapid change of signal strength, EWMA SNR is employed as the measurement of channel condition. e performance of Linkcon is evaluated through simulation. We show that our scheme boosts

up the performance of a system signi cantly compared to other
competing schemes mentioned in the literature. In future we plan
to deploy Linkcon over a testbed and extend its capability under
various mobility scenarios.
