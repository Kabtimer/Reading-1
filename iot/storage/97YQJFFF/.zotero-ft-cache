Preface

Network slicing will play an important role in enhancing the ﬂexibility of the current and future cellular networks. In network slicing, the physical cellular network is divided into multiple virtual networks typically called a slice with heterogeneous capabilities. Each slice is then used to serve the end user. Network slicing gives us the ability to manage and adopt to the heterogeneous requirements imposed by the end users. Moreover, it is envisioned that, for the end users, 5G networks will incorporate many novel applications for vertical industries, each with its own set of stringent requirements. Thus, network slicing will play a pivotal role in meeting these set of requirements for each user (network applications) by allocation of a desired network slice that was not possible in legacy cellular networks.
This book will provide a comprehensive guide to the emerging ﬁeld of network slicing and its importance to bring novel 5G applications into fruition. It discusses the current trends, novel enabling technologies, and current challenges imposed on the cellular networks. Resource management aspects of network slicing are discussed in great detail by summarizing and comparing recent network slicing solutions. Finally, it also presents a use case pertaining to ofﬂoading of data in augmented reality, which is an application for vertical industries. We hope this survey provides an overview on the subject and a direction for future research.

5G Networks

1.1 Introduction
Recent advances in wireless communication has enabled us in improving our tasks, ﬁnancial aspects, well-being, and all the cutting edge enterprises. We assemble, dissect, and share information among various entities to have a proﬁtable life which was impractical before the modern communication networks. Over the recent two decades, wireless communication has developed at an exceptionally quick pace to have a productive and completely digital future.

1.1.1 Evolution of Cellular Systems

The ﬁrst generation (1G) of cellular systems was introduced in 1980 for voice transmission. Frequency division multiple access (FDMA) was used as access technique in the RAN of 1G systems. FDMA requires high gap between channels to avoid interference and each channel had the ability to serve only a single user. With the passage of time the number of users increased and 1G system suffered from the downsides of limited capacity, poor voice quality, and scalability issues. To overcome these downsides, 2G mobile technologies (i.e., GSM, D-AMPS) were developed that were based on time division multiple access (TDMA). Although TDMA allows multiple users per single channel using time sharing, still it requires to have large frequency gaps between the channels to avoid interference. Thus, to further enhance the performance of the cellular networks, third generation (3G) was introduced whose key features were higher capacity and data rates. The 3G uses the access technique of code division multiple access (CDMA) which is based on usage of the same frequencies among multiple users for simultaneous transmission. Although CDMA offers several advantages over its predecessor such as improvement in voice quality and better security, it required building of new

infrastructure and expensive spectrum licensing fee for the operators. Moreover, the proliferation of novel access devices and introduction of new services such as video streaming and social media posed even higher QoS requirements for the operators, thus operators required to further enhance the capacity of the existing cellular systems in order to move from a voice driven system toward a data driven system. This led to the introduction of the fourth generation (4G) of cellular networks that are true IP-based system with even higher data rates and capacity. Moreover, many new features such as band aggregation, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access (OFDMA) as an access scheme, multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) antennas, and beam forming are added in the 4G standard to enhance high data rates and capacity. Moreover, the number of connected devices with huge bandwidth requirements in cellular networks is expected to grow further due to technology adoption of industries and development of low cost Internet of Things devices.
According to Mobile and wireless communications Enablers for Twenty-twenty (2020) Information Society (METIS), there will be 33 times increase in the mobile trafﬁc worldwide in 2020 compared to 2010 [1]. To cope with the gigantic increase in mobile data trafﬁc as evident from the statistics, effective planning of the network is imperative. Furthermore, many efforts are being put by both the industry and academic worlds to meet the requirements posed by 5G networks [2]. Thus, the 5G standard will be driving the future cellular networks [3]. 5G cellular networks are intended to provide peak data rates of up to 10 Gbps, latency up to 1 ms, 1000× number devices, 10 times energy efﬁciency, and high reliability, respectively, according to METIS.1 As a result of massive technological revolutions, the demands posed by end users have increased drastically. To meet such drastic demands, ITU has classiﬁed the future 5G services into three main categories consisting of ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC), enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), and massive machine type communication (mMTC) services. The existing mobile network architecture was designed to meet requirements for voice and conventional mobile broadband (MBB) services. Furthermore, the previous cellular generations were primarily designed to only fulﬁll the human communication requirements such as voice and data. However, 5G networks are expected to facilitate industrial communication as well in order to grow industry digitalization. Thus, enabling innovative services and networking capabilities for new industry stakeholders. The 5G technology is expected to provide connectivity and communication needs with speciﬁc solutions to vertical sectors such as automotive, health care, manufacturing, entertainment, and others in a cost-effective manner. Note that these novel services have very diverse requirements, thus, having traditional RAN and core management solutions for every service cannot guarantee the end user QoS. Moreover, some incremental improvement has been observed due to installation of small cells under macro cell coverage (i.e., heterogeneous networks (HetNets)) especially in congested locations. The concept of HetNets has already been implemented in current networks.2 Other promising approaches for enabling

the future RAN include enabling device to device (D2D) communication to reduce network trafﬁc [4, 5], installing cache storage at the access networks to reduce delays, performing computation at the local base stations for real time analytics, and allowing to use unlicensed spectrum such as LTE-unlicensed (LTE-U) to further enhance the network capacity [6].

1.1.2 Heterogeneous Networks
As the number of devices in the cellular networks has been increasing at an alarming growth rate, a number of novel challenges pertaining to the mobile coverage, capacity limitations, and the required quality of service in the mobile networks need attention. To meet such challenges, a number of small cells are installed under the coverage of traditional macro cells. Such a setting is called the heterogeneous networks in which low power small-cell base stations (SBSs) are operated under the traditional macro cell coverage [7] as shown in Fig. 1.1. Many variants of SBSs, e.g., femto cells or pico cells can be adapted according to the network requirements in an area.

HetNets contribute well in enhancing the spectrum efﬁciency, user coverage, and quality of service while saving the power and enhancing the spectrum resource efﬁciency. Moreover, HetNets have been widely adapted to provide better user experience in outdoor/indoor environments [8].
However, there exist a number of challenges such as interference management, resource allocation, and coverage area management among SBSs and the macro base stations. Various approaches have been proposed to meet these challenges including heuristic-based solutions, game theory-based solutions, matching theorybased solutions, and optimization theory-based solutions.

1.1.3 Device-to-Device Communication
Device-to-device (D2D) communication is one of the key technologies of 5G networks proposed to improve the spectral efﬁciency. In addition to the spectral efﬁciency, D2D has performed well in improving the user data rate, energy efﬁciency, and communication latency. D2D communication is base station independent, direct communication among two or more cellular users (Fig. 1.2). In other words, a D2D pair can directly communicate without routing its trafﬁc through the central

base station. D2D has found its applications mainly in proximity services, disaster situations, and local connectivity. Moreover, a number of study also exist for enabling D2D communication by utilizing the unlicensed spectrum.
Along with such beneﬁts of D2D, there exist the challenges of interference management, resource allocation, and security in D2D and HetNets coexistence networks. As D2D communication is overlay on the existing cellular communication, the interference management and efﬁcient resource allocation for these coexisted networks is challenging. Speciﬁcally, the aim is resource allocation in the coexisted networks by efﬁcient coordination while minimizing the interference.
To meet such challenges, many centralized and distributed approaches have been proposed. Such approaches apply the interference avoidance schemes, conﬂict graphs to reduce interference, and game theory for the contention to access the licensed spectrum. Speciﬁcally, the resource allocation schemes are applied while mitigating the interference between D2D communication and regular cellular communication. The aim of such schemes is to maximize the overall utility of coexisted D2D and heterogeneous network.

1.1.4 LTE-Unlicensed
In order to meet the increasing data rate demands of 5G mobile users, LTEunlicensed (LTE-U) is proposed where the LTE licensed spectrum is augmented with the unlicensed band. Speciﬁcally, LTE is enabled to operate on the licensed and unlicensed spectrum to meet the 5G data rate demands. It is obvious that such operation causes severe performance degradations in the pertaining unlicensed technologies, e.g., Wi-Fi (Fig. 1.3). Therefore a fair mechanism is required for the coexistence of LTE-U and Wi-Fi networks. Licensed assisted access has been standardized by 3GPP where LTE-U is enabled for downlink communication while the uplink communication and control signaling is performed on the licensed band.
Wi-Fi network is based on contention-based MAC known as CSMA where the network users contend for the channel access. Therefore, the random collisions degrade the spectrum efﬁciency. On the other hand, LTE-U is based on centralized MAC where the base station allocates the sub-channels to each cellular user. Therefore, the centralized MAC of LTE-U makes it more spectrally efﬁcient as compared to the distributed MAC of Wi-Fi system which is the motivation of enabling LTE-U.
In order to provide sufﬁcient fairness to the pertaining Wi-Fi networks, LTEU is operated using channel selection or frame scheduling. In the channel selection, listen before talk (LBT) is used to ﬁnd the cleanest channel for LTE-U operation. On the other hand frame scheduling adaptively varies the duty-cycle allocation among Wi-Fi and LTE-U to maintain Wi-Fi throughput up to some threshold.

1.1.5 Non-orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)
In contrast to the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme in which orthogonal channels are allocated to the cellular users in the same vicinity, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is proposed to pack multiple users on the same channel by utilizing the successive interference cancellation and efﬁcient power control. NOMA brings the beneﬁts of better connectivity and spectral efﬁciency. Moreover the limitations of connectivity in OMA scheme are alleviated by proposing NOMAbased communication.
NOMA utilized the successive interference cancellation by exploiting the channel gain differences of the cellular users in a network. In essence, users with difference channel gains are packed on a single channel by allowing them to transmit on different power levels (Fig. 1.4). In order to decode the signal successfully, successive interference cancellation is user after receiving the superimposed signal.
However, operating multiple users on a single channel causes severe interference issues. Efﬁcient power control and user clustering is required to mitigate such interference issues. Efﬁcient user clustering to exploit the channel gain difference can perform well in NOMA scheme. For that purpose, various machine learning tools for clustering are utilized in the literature. After the clustering, the efﬁcient power control algorithms are applied for to achieve optimal cellular rates.

1.1.6 Wireless Network Virtualization
Wireless network virtualization (WNV) is a renowned 5G enabling technology which is proposed for efﬁcient physical resource allocation. The aim of WVN is virtualization of physical resource of infrastructure providers (InPs) and efﬁcient allocation of these virtualized resources to the mobile virtual network operations (MVNOs) (Fig. 1.5).

1 5G Networks

WNV has brought the beneﬁts of ﬂexibility in resource sharing, providing the differentiated services to the communication networks, and the physical resource abstractions. Moreover, the involvement of MVNOs in the resource allocation is improved while signiﬁcantly reducing the computation complexity of InPs.
In WNV, it is challenging to handle the hierarchical structure among cellular users, MVNOs, and InPs. Furthermore, the resource purchasing according to the provided services is a difﬁcult task to be performed by the MVNOs. For that purpose, many solutions consisting of auction-based games, hierarchical games, and matching theory have been proposed in the literature.

1.2 5G Deliverable
5G is envisioned as a novel paradigm of smart world that will enable powerful applications including self-driving cars, augmented reality, smart industries, smart homes, and smart cities. The use cases of 5G networks can be mainly divided into three types such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC), and massive machine type communication (mMTC) as shown in Fig. 1.6 [9]. Mobile broadband has use cases related to human access of data, services, and multimedia content. With the passage of time, the increased demand of users for mobile broadband tended to introduce enhanced mobile broadband (eMMB) that has more advanced applications than mobile broadband [10]. eMBB will enable applications (such as hotspot and wide-area coverage

scenario) with higher capacity, enhanced connectivity, and higher user mobility. Consider the hotspot scenario of a sports event, which consist of large number of users. To serve these users, requirements of low mobility and higher trafﬁc capacity are needed. On the other hand, if we considered a bus, then there are requirements of high mobility and lower capacity than that of the hotspot. Apart from eMBB, mMTC is characterized by massive number of devices that transmit data with low volume and less sensitivity to delay. Other than mMTC, URLLC has strict requirements of higher throughput and low latency. Examples of URLLC applications include remote medical surgery and self-driving cars.
Consider Fig. 1.7, which illustrates the maximum values of speciﬁcations for different parameters such as peak data rates, spectrum efﬁciency, mobility, latency, connection density, network energy efﬁciency, and area trafﬁc capacity [9]. Apart from the speciﬁcations for 5G, the proportion of capabilities compared to peak values for different use cases is also given in Fig. 1.7. Each capability might have different importance in different use case. For example, consider URRLC use case, the importance of mobility and latency is highest compared to other capabilities. On the other hand, mMTC has highest value for connection density than other capabilities. The notion of highest connection density is to ensure the connectivity of massive number of devices that might transmit low rate communication occasionally.

1.3 Industrial Efforts for 5G Networks

1 5G Networks

To turn 5G vision into reality, different industries are working on its implementation to enable the users with new capabilities that they have never experienced before. KT & SKTelecom, Korea are working with Samsung electronics on the development of 5G network. Nokia, Finland and Huawei, China are also working on enhancing the capacities of architecture for different use cases. Nokia is focusing to enable users with 5G mobility service supporting enhanced mobile broadband and 5G mobility service supporting ultra-reliable and ultra-low latency communications. Huawei is working to improve the 5G antenna capabilities. Apart from that, Ericsson, Sweden is also actively participating in 5G networks developments. Recently, Ericsson’s 5G radio was developed that uses beam forming, multi-user MIMO, and massive MIMO.

1.4 Challenges to Realize 5G Networks
5G networks are aimed at providing three types of services such as eMBB services, mMTC services, and URLLC services. However, there exist certain challenges in its implementation that must be addressed.

1.4.1 Scalability and Reliability
Internet of Things (IoT) intends to seamlessly connect the world using smart devices that are heterogeneous in nature. In 5G, the IoT vision is supported more by technologies for mMTC use case applications implementation. To support massive number of IoT devices by 5G, it’s imperative to design a scalable network architecture which is a challenging task [11]. Along with scalability, the design should also provide reliable operation.

1.4.2 Interoperability
In 5G networks, there will be a lot of heterogeneous IoT devices running different protocols. The major challenge in 5G is how to enable seamless interoperability between devices based on different technologies [12]. Enabling interoperability will perhaps allow users to actually realize IoT.

1.4 Challenges to Realize 5G Networks

1.4.3 Sustainability

In 5G, sustainable network operation is imperative as mentioned earlier in this chapter to reduce the overall operation cost. Sustainability in 5G can be achieved either using energy efﬁcient design or renewable energy sources. Along with this, 5G networks can also leverage energy harvesting to reduce their operation cost. However, designing energy efﬁcient system with energy harvesting is a challenging task.

1.4.4 Network Slicing
5G networks will offer a novel applications with diverse requirements as explained in Sect. 1.2. Therefore, the already available mobile networks infrastructure would not be sufﬁcient, which motivated the design of new architecture. To enable 5G applications with diverse requirements, network slicing can be utilized [13]. Network slicing enabled by network function virtualization and software deﬁned networking is aimed at creation of slices of different types for diverse applications. One way to create slices is to assign a part of network end-to-end physical infrastructure resources to only one type of slices; however, his approach has disadvantage of supporting only one slices type by the physical infrastructure. Network slicing should allow the usage of same physical network infrastructure resources to enable the creation of different slices for different services. How to enable the creation of slices for different diverse applications using the same physical infrastructure is a challenging task.

1.4.5 Security
5G networks intend to rapidly rise the vertical industries, all of which impose wide variety of security challenges. For example, the distributed nature of selfdriving cars makes them more susceptible to automotive cyberattacks. Other than that, the key enablers of 5G technology, NFV, and SDN will also add new security challenges. Apart from that, cloud computing and edge computing which are also the key enablers of 5G have security challenges. The centralized architecture of cloud computing has made it more susceptible to attack. Therefore, it’s imperative to design new security mechanisms for 5G networks.

Chapter 2
Network Slicing: The Concept

5G networks are intended to provide mainly three types of services: massive machine type communications (mMTC), ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC), and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB). The mMTC is characterized by massive number of devices communicating with each other and requires low cost along with long battery backup time. Apart from that, URLLC need simultaneous low latency and ultra-reliability. On the other hand, eMBB requires higher data rates along with large coverage area. To enable users with eMBB, mMTC, and URLLC, it’s imperative to redesign the network architecture. Network slicing is a promising candidate to allow 5G networks to offer a wide variety of services and applications such as e-health, augmented reality, smart transportation system, smart banking, smart farming, and mobile gaming. The notion of the network slicing is to leverage the network infrastructure resources for creation of multiple subnetworks for different types of services and applications. Then, each subnetwork will perform slicing of the physical network resources to yield an independent network for its applications. To enable different 5G services, slices of different types for mMTC, URRLC, and eMBB services that utilize the network resources can be created. We can assign each slice type with complete end-to-end network resources; however, it does not seem practical because of the high expense. On the other hand, it would be feasible to allow sharing of the network resources among multiple types of slices using technologies like network function virtualization and software deﬁned networking.

2 Network Slicing: The Concept

Fig. 2.1 5G network slicing [1]
is an emerging concept that will enable the network slicing using software-based solutions. Network softwarization can be achieved through technologies such as network function virtualization and software deﬁned networking. Speciﬁcally, network slicing in 5G will use software deﬁned networking, network function virtualization, cloud computing, and edge computing to enable ﬂexible operation for different types of services over the same physical infrastructure. Network slicing allows the creation of logical networks for different types of services as illustrated in Fig. 2.1 [1]. Each logical network will have independent control with the ability of creation on demand.
The architectural vision of 5G infrastructure by public private partnership project (5G-PPP) proposed the division of network slicing architecture into ﬁve layers such as service layer, infrastructure layer, orchestration layer, business function layer, and network function layer [2]. On the other hand, the next generation mobile network (NGMN) alliance’s architectural vision proposed the division of network slicing architecture into three layers: business application, business enablement, and infrastructure resource [3]. In [4], a generic framework for 5G network slicing is presented as shown in Fig. 2.2. This framework has three layers such as service layer, network function layer, and infrastructure layer. Apart from these three layers, it contains management and orchestration (MANO) entity. The MANO performs the translation of service models and use cases into slices. The network infrastructure layer deals with the physical network infrastructure that covers both core network and radio access network. Other than this, the infrastructure layer also performs infrastructure control and allocation of resources to the slices. Apart from

These network functions are then chained together to deliver an end-to-end service. Following are the deﬁnitions of some terms that will be used later in this chapter.
Software Deﬁned Networking Software deﬁned networking allows the separation of control functionalities from the data transmission network. It actually divides the network into two planes such as data plane for data transmission and centralized control plane for performing control layer functionalities. The main advantage of software deﬁned networking is the easier management due to its centralized nature; however, the centralized controller might suffer from the inefﬁciency when the scale of the network increases [5].
Network Function Virtualization Network function virtualization is envisioned to yield the architecture that allows virtualization of the functionalities of the network nodes, which are then chained together for performing different communication services. A virtual network function might comprise of one or more virtual machines running on different devices such as servers, edge computing nodes, cloud computing infrastructure, and network switches.

2.2 Network Slicing Principles

2 Network Slicing: The Concept

Network slicing principles enable the creation of multiple logical networks on top of the common physical network infrastructure to provide services to different market applications. Network slicing should be done according to the following three main principles.

2.2.1 Slice Isolation
Slice isolation is one of the important properties that should be guaranteed in performing network slicing. It guarantees the performance with security of different tenants by enabling the feature that one tenant slices are independent of the other slices. Apart from that, isolation makes it possible to restrict the tenant user in accessing/modifying the other tenant slices. Isolation is a basic characteristic of the network function virtualization with additional capability of imposing limits on the network resources usage [6]. This feature enables guaranteeing the performance of different tenants by fair sharing of the resources.

2.2.2 Elasticity
Elasticity allows the dynamic alteration of resources allocated to different tenants slices in order to effectively utilize the resources. Elasticity can be realized by relocating the virtual network functions, scaling up/down of the allocated resources, and reprogramming the control and data elements functionalities [7]. The main challenge that will exist in the implementation of the elasticity is the policy for interslice negotiation so that the performance of different slices remains unaffected.

2.2.3 End-to-End Customization
Customization makes sure that allocated shared resources to different tenants are utilized effectively. It is expected that customization will be offered in future by many vertical industries [7]. To enable customization, network function virtualization, software deﬁned networking, and network orchestration can be exploited for providing resource allocation in an agile way.

2.3 Network Slicing Enablers

Network slicing in 5G will be enabled by software deﬁned networking, network function virtualization, cloud computing, and edge computing. 5G architecture is envisioned to provide slices of different services such as eMBB services, URLLC services, and mMTC services. This section discusses the key enablers of the network slicing.

2.3.1 Software Deﬁned Networking
Traditional networking devices were designed to perform a set of functionalities and vendors need to update the design to enable new features. One solution is to build a custom hardware; however, this approach has disadvantage of high cost associated with building of custom hardware. Other than cost, signiﬁcant efforts will be needed to come up with design that meet the most updated speciﬁcations. Once the system is designed, there is no way to make changes in it. All of the above factors motivated researchers to develop novel architecture that will enable conﬁgurable feature. SDN is a solution that is envisioned to enable users with separation of control plane from the underlying network devices, more granular security, lower operating costs, and reduced capital expenditure.
The scale of the network evolution imposes challenges on its management and conﬁguration in a traditional network. SDN centralized architecture enables easier management of the large-scale networks [8] by decoupling the control plane from data plane as shown in Fig. 2.3. The logical control plane has the ability of easier conﬁguration along with effective management functions. In software deﬁned networking, the job of forwarding packets is performed by the centralized network controller through programmable interfaces. Floodlight, Onix, and NOX are the typically used SDN controllers [9]. OpenFlow is the most commonly used interface for controlling the packet ﬂow [10].
The rise in scale of the network imposes stress on the centralized control in SDN. This has limitation effect on the OpenFlow networks scalability [11, 12]. To minimize load on the centralized controller, it is preferable to design an architecture that enables the processing of frequent events near the switches. In [13], a hierarchical architecture is proposed to reduce the load on the centralized controller. The controllers are divided into two categories such as local and root controllers. The local controller is connected to one or more switches, which is further controlled by the root controller. The root controller other than controlling the local controller performs functions that need the network wide view of the network. Apart from kandoo, Hyperﬂow [12] and Onix [14] also performed the distributed implementation of SDN to reduce load on the centralized controller.

2.3.2 Network Function Virtualization
Network function virtualization (NFV) is a concept that leverages virtualization feature for transforming the network nodes functions into virtual functions that can be further chained together to enable different communication services. One or more virtual machines that run on different network nodes such as network switches and servers can be used to run a virtual network function. NFV uses commodity hardware to run software virtualization techniques for implementation of network functions as shown in Fig. 2.4. The virtual appliances have the advantage of instantiating without installation of new hardware. NFV will enable operators with the following advantages:
• Reduction of the capital expenditure by enabling operators with network functions without buying the hardware and payment as per usage.
• It also allows the operators to reduce the operational expenditure required for space, cooling, and power.
• It adds more ﬂexibility to the system by enabling easier and quick scaling of the services.
In the context of network slicing, the framework of network function virtualization enables management of virtual network functions, service chaining [16], and latency oriented virtual network function embedding [7]. The architecture of network function virtualization given in [17] consists of three main components:

The virtual network function manager performs the life cycle management of instances of virtual network functions. The virtual infrastructure manager is responsible for management and control of resources of network function virtualization infrastructure of network operator. The network function virtualization orchestrator performs orchestration of the network resources, validation and authorization of the virtual network function manager requests for resource of network function virtualization infrastructure, and life cycle management of the network service.

2.3.3 Cloud Computing
Cloud computing often called as cloud enables users with on-demand online pool of shared resources that include computing and storage resources, respectively. The cloud follows three types of delivery models such as infrastructure as a service (IAAS), platform as service (PAAS), and software as service (SAAS). SAAS allows users with on-demand use of softwares without installing it on a local personal computer. The software runs on cloud that is available for users and the users only pay for the software as per the use in a cheap way. Further, the users can access the software regardless of the location and enjoy more freedom of working in a group of peoples located at different places. The cloud software can be accessed either via client application or a browser. Examples of SAAS are dropbox, Gmail, Microsoft ofﬁce 365, Facebook, etc. Apart from SAAS, PAAS allows the users with platform for development of applications and is made up of a database, browser, operating system, and programming language execution environment.

In IAAS, the virtualized computing resources are offered as a service via internet. Examples of IAAS include Amazon EC2, Gogrid, DigitalOcean, Cisco Metapod, and Google Compute Engine (Fig. 2.5).

Cloud Deployment Models
The cloud deployment models convey the nature and purpose of the cloud. Five types of cloud deployment models are identiﬁed by the NIST [18].
Private Cloud The computing and storage resources in a private cloud are owned by a single organization. In a private cloud, the users data is protected by the ﬁrewall and relationship between vendor and customer can be determined easily due to the reason of involvement of a single organization in the operation and management. Therefore, it is easy to detect the security risks. On the other hand, private cloud has disadvantage of operation, maintenance, and updating by a single organization, which might increases the overall cost.
Public Cloud The cloud services in a public cloud are owned by a third party service provider and provided through internet. All the software, hardware, and supporting infrastructure are managed and owned by the cloud service provider. This type of cloud deployment has the advantage of low cost and more reliability, but suffered from security concerns.
Community Cloud Community cloud allows several organizations to share the cloud infrastructure which is managed either by a third party or internally. The involved organizations worked for common business goals and similar needs. The

use of community clouds is attractive for organizations that have constraint of regulatory compliance such as ﬁnancial and e-health organizations.
Hybrid Cloud Hybrid clouds leverages the advantages of both private and public clouds to yield services with more ﬂexibility. Private cloud can be used for services that require more security like processing of conﬁdential information while public clouds can be used for services that need less security. Hybrid cloud enable users to leverage different cloud models which allow trade-off between different aspects of cloud computing. For example, a researcher will prefer to use private cloud for running critical workloads while prefer to use public cloud for database services.
Virtual Private Cloud Virtual private cloud is the shared pool of allocated resources in a public cloud with on-demand and conﬁgurable features. In virtual private cloud, the user data is isolated from other companies data using private IP addresses, cloud storage, and servers to achieve enhanced security.

Requirements for Cloud Computing in 5G
This sections explains the requirements for cloud computing architecture in 5G. These requirements can be divided into three categories such as provider requirements, enterprise requirements, and user requirements [19].
Reliability One of the most important requirements is the reliability that must be fulﬁlled in the cloud system. The cloud computing system might suffer from hardware and software ﬂaws due to which it will not work properly. The system should be designed in way that must be resilient to both type of ﬂaws because of the fact that some applications (such as vehicular communication and e-health) in 5G require ultra-high reliability.
Sustainability Sustainability deals with the use of renewable energy source and energy efﬁcient hardware design. In 5G, we will witness a massive number of devices that will access the network, therefore, it’s imperative to design the sustainable system that will fulﬁll the users requirements without adding pollution to the environment.
Scalability It deals with the management of increase in complexity due to an increase in computation tasks. Scalability in clouds can be either horizontal or vertical. Horizontal scalability is provided through load balancing. On the other hand, vertical scaling is to scale up capacity through increase in server resources. Most common way to do vertical scaling is to use expensive hardware and then utilize the hardware as a virtual machine hypervisor.
Fault Tolerance Fault tolerance is the ability of a cloud computing system to continue its operation if some of its component stops working. For example, Microsoft Azure encountered an outage of 22 h in March 13th and 14th, 2008 [19]. The cloud service provider should design the fault tolerant system that detect failure on time and then, apply mechanisms to recover from the outage within short time.

2 Network Slicing: The Concept

Security and Privacy Security and privacy should be considered in the design of the cloud computing system. Privacy deﬁnes the rules of who can access the users information while security is to protect the data from the attack of the malicious users. Cloud computing systems are more vulnerable to attacks due to its centralized nature, therefore, effective security algorithm should be designed to avoid the attack of the malicious user. A malicious attacker might attack the cloud and cause the outage of the service easily due to its centralized nature.

2.3.4 Edge Computing
Although cloud computing provides the advantages of scalability, elasticity, resource pooling, and sufﬁcient storage capacity, the high latency associated with cloud makes it unattractive for real time and resource-intensive applications. To enable users with resource-intensive and latency sensitive applications such as augmented reality and e-health, edge computing comes into the picture which leverages pushing of the storage and computing resources to the edge of the network. In literature, three different terms such as cloudlets, fog computing, and mobile edge computing appeared till now and are based on pushing of the computing and storage resources to the network end. All of these terms represent edge computing with different context awareness, scope, and edge nodes nature features, respectively. The term cloudlet was coined by Satyanarayanan et al. to enable the placement of small-scale data center at the network edge for execution of resource-intensive applications [20]. Fog computing was coined by CISCO to refer to architecture that uses the edge devices (such as routers and gateways) to allow users with computing and storage capabilities [21]. The term mobile edge computing was coined by European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to propose the placement of servers at the base stations [22].

2.4 Summary
5G networks are envisioned to offer three types of services such as mTC, URRLC, and eMBB. Each of these use cases has diverse network requirements. To enable these diverse use cases applications, network slicing is a promising candidate. Network slicing enables different applications by creating logical slices over the top of the physical infrastructure. This chapter describes the concept of network slicing. Moreover, slicing principles such as slice isolation, elasticity, and end-toend customization are also explained. Finally, the key network slicing enablers such as software deﬁned networking, network function virtualization, cloud computing, and edge computing are also explained.

Resource Management for Network Slicing

3.1 Motivation and Introduction
Massive advancements in wireless networks have helped us in optimizing our operations, economics, health, and all modern industries. Among wireless networks, the cellular networks have received the most popularity [1].
A cellular communication network can broadly be categorized into two parts, the core network and the radio access network. This chapter focuses on the latter part of cellular communication, i.e., radio access network. A radio access network (RAN) is an integral part of the cellular communication system that implements the radio access technology (RAT) to enable the subscribers to access the core network (CN). A typical RAN consists of both wireless and wired links along with control or switching sites [2]. In a cellular system, the limited resources must be shared effectively among its subscriber to enhance the overall quality of service (QoS) of the network [3]. In the following subsection, we brieﬂy present the evolution of cellular systems, shortcoming of previous generations, and 5G speciﬁcations along with the enabling technologies that will support in bringing the 5G networks into fruition. Then, we discuss about different types of resources available at the RAN of future cellular systems that require to be managed for effective operations.

3.1.1 Radio Access Network Resource Management

Resource management especially in the RANs is considered as the most crucial aspect of resource management due to limited and geographically distributed resources. Furthermore, the future RAN will be a very complex mixture of heterogeneous coexisting technologies that would require tight coordination for utilizing the shared and limited resources [4]. The resources in a 5G RAN can be broadly categorized into three categories: (1) spectrum and power resources

available in radio access terminal for carrying out communication [5], (2) cache resources available for storage in the BS to reduce access delays, and (3) edge computing resources available at the access networks for performing real time computation.
The limited wireless spectrum in the RANs poses the biggest challenge that requires to be addressed. This limited wireless spectrum experiences severe congestion due the proliferation of new network devices and bandwidth hungry applications [6, 7]. To address this issue, new spectrum above 6 GHz is considered by 5G new radio (NR) for addressing speciﬁc use cases requiring extremely high data rates. Note that bands below 6 GHz are crucial to support wide-area coverage and 5G scenarios of mMTC. The 5G NR would be capable to operate on multiple bands to address diversiﬁed requirements from the envisioned 5G usage scenarios. Moreover, power management on this spectrum will also play a very crucial role for enhancing the performance. Therefore, the main goal is to develop efﬁcient RAN schemes for spectrum and power allocation that can efﬁciently perform resource management [8].
Caching is used to store the popular contents temporarily in a cache to enable lower latency and reduced backhaul usage. According to statistics, video streaming trafﬁc aids a signiﬁcant portion of 54% to the whole INTERNET trafﬁc which is intended to grow up to 71% in 2019 [9]. Most often the users request similar video contents frequently which induces overhead on the backhaul networks. Caching the content at the BS will reduce the congestion of the backhaul links and latency experienced by the user, respectively. However, cache space is very limited compared to the number of contents. This requires to design efﬁcient caching schemes for saving popular contents that can be reused later with minimum delay. Thus, efﬁcient caching schemes are required for 5G RANs that will play a vital role in bringing these novel services such as URLLC service into fruition.
The 5G network will require to perform a number of computation tasks especially after the advent of Internet of Things (IoTs). Efﬁcient computation will play a vital role in realizing a number of real time services. One option is to adopt cloud computing for such services. Cloud computing enhances the user’s overall QoE by providing the shared computing and storage resources online as a service in elastic, sustainable, and reliable manner. Although cloud computing offers signiﬁcant advantages, latency sensitive applications such as self-driving cars, mission critical applications, industrial automation, and augmented reality incur performance degradation because of the distant locations of the cloud. Edge computing is a solution to delay sensitive application that pushes the computing resources to the edge of the network. In [10], Satyanarayanan et al. presented the concept of cloud-let, a small-scale data center positioned at the network edge to enable the execution of resource-intensive applications with low latency. In [11], CISCO coined the term fog computing, an architecture based on usage of edge devices to enable local computing resources. Mobile edge computing (MEC) was the term coined by European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) [12], to allow the placement of storage and computing resources at the base station (BS).

3.1 Motivation and Introduction

To fulﬁll these diverse heterogeneous requirements posed by vertical industries, a novel and promising concept of network slicing can be adopted. Network slicing enables one physical network into multiple, virtual, end-to-end (E2E) networks, each logically isolated including device, access, transport, and core network. A slice is dedicated for different types of service with characteristics and requirements pertaining to the required service by the vertical industry.

3.1.2 Network Slicing
Network slicing has recently attracted signiﬁcant attention due to its wide applicability for 5G networks [13]. Through network slicing, the physical infrastructure of a cellular operator can be logically divided into slices of heterogeneous capabilities that can support various services with different requirements [14, 15]. For example, an operator can provide a dedicated slice of speciﬁc network capabilities for handling augmented reality applications with ultra-reliable and low latency communications and another dedicated slice with different network capabilities for video-on-demand services that require high throughput. This enables network operators to provide network-as-a service and enhances the network efﬁciency. One important aspect in enabling network slicing is to enforce strong isolation between different slices such that any actions in one slice does not affect other operating slices.
Network slicing is also being supported by 3GPP by deﬁning a novel network architecture that supports slicing. In particular, the 3GPP working group SA2 has already deﬁned the basis for building an evolved core network infrastructure managing multiple slices on the same network infrastructure [16]. Network slicing can be easily realized due to the revolutionary technologies of software deﬁned networks (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV). The work in [17] presents a detailed survey on wireless resource slicing and the challenges associated with isolations of wireless slices. Similarly, other notable works related to novel network slicing architectures can be found in [18–20]. All these aforementioned works basically discuss how to enable network slicing and its beneﬁts in 5G networks. Speciﬁcally, they discuss the roles and interactions of network slicing enablers such as software deﬁned networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) in the 5G network architecture. They do not consider speciﬁc algorithmic approaches for slice creation, slice allocation, slice interactions, admission control, etc. Moreover, considering the potential beneﬁts of network slicing a number of mobile operators have shown keen interest and efforts in adopting network slicing in their network. SK Telecom and Ericsson successfully demonstrated network slice creation and operation for augmented reality solutions in 2015. Similarly, a proof of concept for 5G core was provided in 2016 by Ericsson and NTT DoCoMo by enabling dynamic network slicing. Other notable efforts pertaining to network slicing have been demonstrated by operators such as Huawei, Deutsche Telekom, ZTE, and China Mobile.

3 Resource Management for Network Slicing

Even though there is technology development on network slicing, the majority of them focused on slicing at the core network due to massive advancements in SDN, virtualization, and NVF technologies. On the other hand, there are limited researches in the radio access network (RAN) slicing, in which most of them focused on slicing a single RAN resource, e.g., either spectrum or base station (BS) [18–22]. Note that network capacity is inarguably a critical resource of RAN, however, other resources of RAN such as cache space [23, 24], backhaul capacity, and computing at the RAN also need to be considered for RAN network slicing such as the work in [25] considers caching and backhaul limitation of 5G RANs.

3.2 RAN Resources
This section provides overview of the current advances in resource management of the RAN of the next generation cellular networks. In this work, we speciﬁcally discuss about three types of important resources available in the RAN, i.e., radio resources, cache resources, and MEC resources.

3.2.1 Radio Resources
The efﬁcient spectrum management in 5G cellular networks is imperative to enable mobile subscribers with higher data rates, reduced latency, and ultra-reliability. The radio resource management has two main challenges of spectrum scarcity and spectrum resource allocation [26]. To tackle the issue of spectrum scarcity, researchers are trying to explore new high radio frequency bands. In 5G, cellular networks technology is intending to use millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies band to enable higher data rates [27]. Other than spectrum scarcity, we can leverage optimal spectrum management to improve the quality of service [28]. Some recent proposals are discussed in the following paragraph.
In [29], Adedoyin et al. considered a two-tier network consisting of macro cells and dense deployed femto cells with co-channel assignments. They have formulated the problem of radio resource allocation as an optimization problem which is of mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) type and whose objective is to minimize the total transmit power. The MINLP problem is transformed into a simple problem as a mixed integer linear Programming using reformation-linearization technique and then, QoS-based radio resource management algorithm is proposed to minimize the interference and improve QoS. The key contribution of their work lies in the consideration of the joint resources allocation and power control for femto cells. The problem of resource allocation in two-tier HetNets is also considered in [30]. In resource allocation, the macro cell protection is achieved through the

3.2 RAN Resources

29

use of constraints on cross-tier interference. The problem of resource allocation is formulated as mixed-integer resource allocation problem which is solved using two different algorithms. One algorithm is based on duality-based optimization approach and the other one is proposed based on matching theory.
In [31], a downlink resource allocation in two-tier HetNets using the same frequency for small cells and macro cells is considered. The objective function is to minimize the total power that jointly takes into account the circuit power and transmission power. The proposed energy efﬁcient scheme uses both progressive analysis and linear integer binary programming. Their proposed scheme allows the switching off the underutilized small cells which increase the energy efﬁciency. Liu et al. in [32] proposed an algorithm based on stable matching theory for resource allocation in two-tier HetNets. The problem is formulated to maximize the sum rate of the femto cell user equipment and then, matching game-based algorithm is proposed for resource allocation.

3.2.2 Caching
Caching is used to store the popular contents temporarily in a cache at intermediate locations in a network to jointly enable the fast access and elimination of duplicate transmission. Most often the users request same video contents frequently, which induce signiﬁcant overhead on the backhaul networks. Caching the content at the BSs will reduce jointly the congestion of the backhaul links and latency experienced by the end user. The architecture of cache enabled cellular networks can be divided into four categories, i.e., cache enabled C-RAN, cache enabled macro cellular networks, cache enabled D2D networks, and cache enabled HetNets, respectively [33]. Other than position of cache installation, the control structure of the caching in cellular networks can be either centralized or decentralized. In a centralized structure, the placement and delivery of the content is controlled by a centralized entity while in decentralized control, the placement and delivery of the content is controlled by the BS or the user equipment. The choice of control structure depends on the trade-off between the complexity and achievement of global optimal solution. The decentralized algorithms have lower complexity than centralized one but might not achieve global optimal solution.
In 5G HetNets, cache can be placed at different positions in a radio access network such as at macro cell BS, small cell BS, and devices, respectively. In [34, 35], cache is placed at the BS in a single tier network. The authors in [34], proposed a caching scheme based on usage of BSs collaboration for minimizing the aggregated cost required to deliver ﬁles. They have considered both coded (content can be stored at multiple BSs) and non-coded caching (content can be stored only at a single BS if cached otherwise no caching is considered). The problem of caching for non-coded case is formulated as integer program to minimize the aggregated

30

3 Resource Management for Network Slicing

cost and is proven to be NP-complete. Then, a near-optimal algorithm using dynamic programming is proposed. On the other hand for the non-coded caching scenario, the problem is formulated as linear program which has a polynomial time solution. The limitation of their work lies in usage of information about the popularities of the contents whose accurate estimation might be difﬁcult. In [35], energy efﬁcient caching is proposed to jointly optimize the cache placement and cache hit ratio. A technique using short noise model (SNM) is proposed to estimate the content popularity. The cache hit rate is then improved by proposing distributed caching policy. Along with this, the authors have formulated caching problem as an optimization problem and presented a closed-form solution that maximizes the energy efﬁciency for the optimal cache capacity. In [34, 35], the authors considered the cache located at BSs of a single tier network. On the other hand, cache can be placed at both macro cells and small cells which allows the users to access the contents from the nearest BS. Apart from small cells in HetNets, cache enabled D2D communication enables the users to communicate without traversing the BS with each device having the capability of cache.
Yang et al. in [36] considered a three tier network that consists of D2D pairs, relays, and BSs. The node (uses, relays, and BSs) locations are ﬁrst modeled as mutually independent Poisson point processes and then, protocol for content access is proposed. Along with this, the authors derived analytically expressions for outage probability and average ergodic rate for subscribers considering different cases. Further, derivation of delay and throughput using continuous-time Markov process and multiclass processor-sharing model are also performed. The authors considered unicast point-to-point transmission, which minimizes the backhaul trafﬁc but fails to reduce “on air” congestion effectively. Along with this, the wireless medium broadcast nature in contrast to wired medium is not effectively exploited.

3.2.3 Edge Computing Servers
Edge computing is a solution to delay sensitive application that pushes the computing resources to edge of the network. In [10], Satyanarayanan et al. presented the concept of cloud-let, a small-scale data center positioned at the network edge to enable the execution of resource-intensive applications with low latency. In [11], CISCO coined the term fog computing, an architecture based on usage of edge devices to enable local computing resources. Mobile edge computing (MEC) was the term coined by European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) [12], to allow the placement of storage and computing resources at the base station (BS). A comprehensive survey of MEC is presented in [37]. Resource management in MEC can be divided into three categories such as single user MEC systems, multiuser MEC systems, and MEC systems with heterogeneous servers, respectively. Other than that, ofﬂoading can be either binary ofﬂoading that is based

3.2 RAN Resources

31

on ofﬂoading the whole task to the MEC server or partial ofﬂoading that is based on ofﬂoading the partial task to the MEC server for execution.
The partial task ofﬂoading has been considered in [38, 39]. You et al. in [39] studied the resource allocation for multiusers in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and time division multiple access (TDMA) based multiuser MEC systems, respectively. The resource allocation problem for TDMA based MEC system is formulated as a convex optimization problem for minimizing the summation of the weighted user equipment energy considering the constraints of computation latency, MEC server computation capacity, and time sharing, respectively. The priority-based optimal resource allocation strategy is proposed that is based on assigning higher priority to users having insufﬁcient local computation resources to run the applications within allowed time. On the other hand, the resource allocation problem for OFDMA-based multiuser MEC is formulated as a mixed-integer problem. This problem is solved through sub-optimal algorithm having low complexity which is based on transformation of OFDMA problem into its counterpart TDMA problem. The key advantage of the priority-based algorithm is consideration of both channel gain and local computing energy of multiple users; however, high complexity is associated with the proposed algorithms when the capacity of the MEC is considered ﬁnite, which seems more practical than considering MEC servers with inﬁnite capacity to reduce the complexity of the proposed algorithm. In [38], the authors proposed a partial ofﬂoading system for a single user MEC system. A cost function is formulated for a single user application that incorporates both local execution time and ofﬂoaded execution time. The cost of the local execution only considers the local execution delay while the ofﬂoaded execution cost is weighted sum of three factors such as: delay occurred in ofﬂoading and sending the task back to the user, usage of computational resources at small cell MEC server, and radio resource usage. The objective function is to minimize the sum of the cost function for all components of a task. The authors proposed a deep supervised-based learning approach to solve the partial ofﬂoading problem. Their proposed approach has lower complexity such as O(mn)2 for n task components of an application with m hidden layers, than the exhaustive algorithm which has complexity O(2n). The prime limitation of the proposed approach lies in requirement of large data set for training system prior to use.
The binary task ofﬂoading has been considered in [40, 41]. The authors in [40] considered a single user MEC system with another energy harvesting. The authors deﬁned an execution cost function which is the weighted sum of the task dropping cost and execution delay. The dropping cost reﬂects to the tasks that are dropped either due to deep fading or due to lack of energy at the mobile device, which is only powered by the harvested energy in their system model. The problem is formulated as optimization problem to minimize the time average of the execution cost. Further, they have proposed online Lyapunov optimization-based approach to solve the optimization problem. The proposed online algorithm has advantage of non-usage of distribution of the computation task request process and channel

32

statistics. The main disadvantage of the proposed system is usage of only harvesting source for powering the mobile device. There are signiﬁcant random variations in the harvesting energy either from the natural sources or radio frequency sources. Therefore, it is practically more feasible to use hybrid energy sources that utilize both harvested energy and grid energy to enable the continuous operation of the devices. In [41], the ﬂeet of drones (user’s nodes) running resource-intensive tasks such as identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of objects is considered. A cost function to jointly minimize the delay and energy consumption is deﬁned and then, a game theory-based distributed ofﬂoading scheme is proposed. The theoretical game with three different strategies (such as local task computation, task ofﬂoading to a BS through a local wireless network, and ofﬂoading of task to a server through cellular network) and drones as players is considered to perform task ofﬂoading. The proposed approach has advantage of its distributed nature; however, its associated complexity has not been discussed in the paper.

3.3 Use Case: Virtual Reality (VR)
Virtual reality (VR) is an interactive digital real time experience taking place with a simulated artiﬁcial environment. It mainly includes audio and visual interactions. The goal of a VR system is to generate a real time virtual environment that mimics the human perceptions. To support this real time virtual environment, the wireless system needs to cope with massive amount of bandwidth and latency requirements which was not possible with the previous cellular generations. Indeed some VR technologies such as VR goggles are already emerging, however, the full potential of VR systems to achieve a fully immersive experience is yet to be explored. A detailed work on VR requirements, its enablers, and its challenges are discussed in [42]. In this work, we focus on one of the most important requirements of VR, i.e., ofﬂoading computation task. In this use case, we consider the computation ofﬂoading use case of a VR. Migrating computationally intensive tasks from VR devices to more resourceful cloud/fog servers is necessary to increase the computational capacity of VR devices.

3.3.1 System Model
Let N = {1, . . . , N } be the set of N mobile users with VR capability as shown in Fig. 3.1, and M = {1, . . . , M} be the set of M MEC servers. Each mobile user i ∈ N has a computational task to ofﬂoad that is denoted by τi = {Si, Ti, Ci}, where T is the worst case execution time of the task, C is the budget of user i for ofﬂoading

the task, and Si is size of the task. Moreover, we assume the task to be a video task. Typically, in a video frame, there are four components: horizontal pixels, vertical pixels, frame rate, and color depth, therefore, we consider Si = {Hi, Vi, Fi, Li}, where H is horizontal pixels, V is vertical pixels, F is number of frames per second, and L is the length of video. Thus, the size of video is calculated using the following equation:

(3.1)

In this work, we assume that the bandwidth allocated for user i from different MEC j is different, di,j = di,k, ∀i ∈ N , ∀j, k ∈ M, j = k. This difference depends upon factors such as location, distance, and power level of devices. In our model, we consider two main factors pertaining to a user that affect the ofﬂoading decision: processing cost of the task and the transmission time of the task. Thus, we have two cases for any user i ∈ N . The ﬁrst case occurs when user i directly uploads to the cloud server. In this case, let ci0 be the cost for data storage where ci0 is calculated using a linear function with coefﬁcient δ. The goal of assuming a linear cost function is to enable the pay as you go policy. This means the more data is uploaded, the more cost is required to be paid. The second case occurs when user i uploads the task to an MEC server. Note that each MEC server has a limit on its processing capacity which is denoted by Γj . Now, we deﬁne a bandwidth allocation matrix for the uplink transmission:

3 Resource Management for Network Slicing

⎡

⎤

u11 . . . u1M

U = ⎢⎣ ... . . . ... ⎥⎦

uN1 . . . uNM

(3.2)

where uij is the uplink bandwidth allocated for user i when ofﬂoading to MEC j .
Given the bandwidth and size of the video frames xij , the uplink transmission time tiuj can be calculated as follows:

tiuj

=

xij . uij

(3.3)

And the processing cost as:

cij = δj × xij .∀j ∈ M

(3.4)

Similar to the cloud case, here also we use the linear cost function for calculating the processing cost in order to follow the pay-as-you-go policy and δ represents the coefﬁcients of the cost function.
Then, the bandwidth allocation matrix for the downlink transmission can be represented by:

⎡

⎤

d11 . . . d1M

D = ⎢⎣ ... . . . ... ⎥⎦

dN1 . . . dNM

(3.5)

where uij is the downlink bandwidth allocated for user i when associated with MEC
j . Given the size of output Si from MEC j , the downlink transmission time can be deﬁned as follows:

tjdi

=

ηxij dij

,

(3.6)

where η is the coefﬁcient representing the relation between input and output data. For example, η = 0:5 mean that the result is equal to 50% of input data. Then, the total transmission cost is deﬁned as follows:

tij = tiuj + tjdi

(3.7)

Note that the transmitted and received time for a user i from the central cloud server is denoted by tiu0, and t0di, respectively. Moreover, we assume that the demand of users is to be served at the MEC for low processing time given it has enough
capability. Therefore, to minimize the total cost of the end user, we normalize the
total transmission and processing cost functions by dividing it with the original cost,
i.e., cost required for a user i when it uploads its task to the cloud server.

Our objective function (3.10) considers both the transmission and processing cost in which α represents the trade-off coefﬁcient that ranges from [0, 1]. Constraint (3.11) guarantees that all demand is served by the network whereas the constraint (3.12) represents that the MEC capacity is not violated. Furthermore, the constraint (3.13) states that the budget of any user does not exceed the processing cost. Lastly, constraints (3.15), (3.16) state that the cost of transmission and processing at MEC

are less compared to that of a central cloud, respectively. To solve this problem we use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach. ADMM has the capability of parallel solving the designed problem in a distributed fashion in which each user or MEC server will solve their individual variable(s). Next, we describe our designed approach.

3.3.3 ADMM-Based Solution

First we deﬁne the objective function (3.10) as follows which is equivalent to:

We then deﬁne the feasible set for the problem (3.22) as follows:

X = {xi|(3.23), (3.24), (3.25), (3.26), (3.27), (3.28), (3.29)}

(3.30)

Then, following the ADMM framework, we introduce a new variable z such that

where h(z) = 0 when xi ∈ X .

Algorithm 1 represents the pseudocode of our approach. Initially, we input the set of users, MEC servers, and its downlink and uplink allocation capabilities. Then, we initialize all the variables for the ﬁrst iteration and ﬁx the maximum number of iterations to 1000 runs. Moreover the Lagrangian penalty term and tradeoff coefﬁcient is set to 0.5. For each iteration, each user i updates its ofﬂoading decision. Once all users update their respective ofﬂoading decision, the MEC updates the Lagrange multiplier variable. This is followed by updating the objective function (3.10) based on the current iteration. After limited iterations, the solution converges to an optimal value.

3.3.4 Performance Analysis
In our simulation, the MECs are assumed to be deployed at a ﬁxed location, and N mobile users are deployed following a homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP). The input parameters of downlink and uplink bandwidth allocation follow a homogeneous uniform distribution ranging from [0 5]. In our simulations, the η value is varied from 0.4 to 0.7. Moreover, all statistical results are taken by averaging over 100 simulation runs of random location of users and bandwidth allocation. Furthermore, we also provide performance comparison by comparing our scheme (i.e., ADMM-based approach) with three other schemes. The ﬁrst scheme uses a centralized method in which the optimal solution is calculated using the “convex .JL.” We represent this scheme as “centralized” scheme. Then, we calculate the solution using a greedy approach in which the best ﬁrst search approach is used to select the ofﬂoading decision of user to MEC. This scheme is represented as “greedy” scheme. Finally, the last scheme is the “random” scheme in which we pick random MECs for ofﬂoading its task with uniform distribution.
Figure 3.2 represents the average utility obtained by all the schemes by increasing the number of MECs in the network. It can be seen that the average utility increases with number of MEC servers. Moreover, the performance of the proposed scheme is signiﬁcantly higher than the greedy and random scheme. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed ADMM scheme is indifferentiable from the centralized scheme, i.e., optimal solution under all scenarios.
Similarly, Fig. 3.3 represents the average processing cost obtained by all the schemes by increasing the number of MECs in the network. It can be inferred that the processing cost decreases as the number of MEC servers increases in the network as tasks are divided among more servers. Similarly, the performance of ADMM scheme is similar to the centralized scheme, thus obtaining an optimal solution.

3.4 Summary

3 Resource Management for Network Slicing

Radio resource management is categorized among the biggest challenge for the 5G networks due to the proliferation of heterogeneous devices. Moreover, the introduction of 5G verticals and the need to fulﬁll heterogeneous stringent requirements based on novel applications further complicates the radio resource management process. In this chapter, we present an overview of radio resources available in RAN and some recent approaches to manage the network. Moreover, we also discuss about network slicing which can be considered as a promising scheme to meet these heterogeneous requirements produced by various 5G verticals. Finally, we provide a use case that focuses on one of the most important requirements of virtual reality (VR), i.e., ofﬂoading computation task. Ofﬂoading intensive tasks to more resourceful devices such as clouds or MEC servers increases the computational capacity of VR devices.

Chapter 4
Network Slicing: Radio Resource Allocation

Radio resource allocation has always been considered to be a challenging task in the cellular networks due to limited spectrum. This becomes even more challenging as ﬁfth generation (5G) cellular networks have an even higher expectation in terms of facilitating end users with higher data rate and lower end-to-end latency. Moreover, 5G also targets to improve spectrum/energy efﬁciency and reduced cost for operators. One promising technology that can support to deliver is wireless network virtualization (WNV) [1, 20, 24]. Virtualization of physical resources in the data centers has played a signiﬁcant role to enhance the performance by enabling abstraction and resource sharing among competing entities. Through virtualization we can reduce the operational cost of the network, provide ease of management to the operators and decoupled functionalities. WNV is a novel concept for virtualizing the radio access networks (RAN) of future cellular networks. Broadly, WNV ranges from spectrum sharing, infrastructure virtualization, to air interface virtualization. Thus, WNV abstracts the physical wireless infrastructure and radio resources to enable resource sharing among parties and enchaining the usability of the network resources [20, 24]. These resources are then isolated to a number of virtual resources (slices) and the main goal is to assign slices to different mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) such that the network utility is maximized.
In this chapter, we discuss about the vital challenges of WNV, a number of solution approaches, and their beneﬁts for different WNV scenarios. First, we discuss about the resource allocation problem in which one InP allocates their resources to different MVNO users. The proposed solution for the aforementioned problem allocates resources in such a manner that sum-rate of the network is maximized. Second, we discuss about resource allocation approach in a multiple InP environment. Moreover, these approaches consider spectrum resources as the OFDMA-based sub-channels. Note that in OFDMA-based scheme, the allocation will be limited by the number of spectrum resources (i.e., sub-channels, resource blocks).

4 Network Slicing: Radio Resource Allocation

4.1 Radio Resource Allocation with Single InP

Typically, in network virtualization, the network is divided into two components: (1) the infrastructure providers (InPs) and (2) mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). The role of an InP is to own the physical infrastructure (e.g., base station, resource blocks (RBs), backhaul, and core network) and operates the physical wireless network. On the other hand, each MVNOs will lease these InP resources to develop its own wireless network (virtual network) in order to provide services to its end users. Typically each slice is created to support a service such as VoIP, video telephony, live streaming, and video conferencing for registered users. Thus, virtualization of wireless network enables coexistence of multiples MVNOs on a shared infrastructure opposed to the traditional approach in which both the infrastructure and mobile networks were closely coupled. Through WNV this tight coupling can be removed and each InP can share its resources with multiple MVNOs (Fig. 4.1).
Efﬁcient resource allocation will improve the resource utilization, energy efﬁciency, and quality of services of the network. In WNV, two kinds of resource provisioning are done when allocating resources to MVNOs: (1) rate-based provi-

sioning in which minimum rate is guaranteed to the MVNO and (2) resource-based provisioning in which minimum number of resources are provided to the MVNOs. Moreover, there is an additional signiﬁcant challenge pertaining to resource allocation in WNV, i.e., resource isolation among MVNOs. The goal is to enforce strong isolation between slices, i.e., actions in one slice do not affect another slices in the network. Thus, a number of recent resource allocation approaches in wireless network virtualization have been proposed in recent works [9, 10, 17–19, 25].
The authors in [11] designed an efﬁcient virtual resource allocation scheme for WNV to handle the “isolation” challenge. Moreover, they propose a novel approach that considers the beneﬁts for both the InP and MVNOs simultaneously. Two-sided matching game was employed to solve the designed allocation problem due to its special and unique ability to describe individual players roles, i.e., InP, MVNOs, and users. Matching theory is appropriate for tackling the designed problem because of the following reasons [15].
• Interactions among different type of players can be precisely described through preference proﬁles of players.
• Unique properties in the objective function, for example, convexity is not required to achieve an analytical tractability solution.
• Solutions for matching algorithm can guarantee key properties such as stability and optimality which makes them appropriate for online execution.
Thus, the key contribution of this work [11] can be summarized as follows:
• They formulated resource allocation in WNV as a matching game problem. To solve this problem, they also deﬁned the preference proﬁle for each player.
• Second, they proposed a low-complexity and stable solution for the designed resource allocation which also guaranteed the isolation constraint. Finally, they also showed that Pareto optimality is achieved by the designed solution.

4.1.1 System Model
In the system model, authors assumed a single base station (BS) owned by an infrastructure provider (InP). Moreover, the base station operated on a spectrum represented by a set C of orthogonal sub-channels each with bandwidth w. InP gives services based on some service level agreements (SLA) to a set V of mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) and it is assumed that each MVNO v has a set of associated users as Kv. Note that an InP builds virtual resource (VR) slices based on the MVNOs demand, these slices are then allocated to MVNOs users. Generally, isolation is a primary requirement in WNV between slices of different VNOs. In this work, the authors consider that isolation between different MVNOs is achieved by guaranteeing a predetermined data rate which allows dynamic sharing of spectrum. Table 4.1 shows the notations used in this work.

In their model for VR allocation, a binary variable xvc,k is used:

if MVNOs v user k is assigned VR c, otherwise.

Moreover, they state that one user will require only one VR. Then the following constraint holds:

xvc,k ≥ 1, ∀k ∈ Kv, ∀v ∈ V.
c∈C

(4.1)

Note that xvc,k = 0 for any user k of MVNO v with no assigned VR c. Then, the received SINR for a user k over c that has transmit power Pvc is given by:

γvc,k =

Pvc gvc,k Plc glc,k

l ∈V ,l =v

(4.2)

where Plc is the transmit power of MVNO l user, the gain is represented by gvc,k between an MVNO v and user k. Similarly, glr,k represents the gain between the MVNO l user k and MVNO v. Therefore, the achievable rate of any user k is given
by:

rvc,k = xvc,kW log(1 + γvc,k),

(4.3)

where W is the bandwidth of VR c. Next, the authors also study the affect for selﬁsh players. This is considered
important in WNV [8] as all players play to enhance their utility. In WNV, cost reduction is considered as the main goal, i.e., InP plays for maximizing its revenue while MVNO plays to reduce its cost that is required to be paid to the InP on receiving the VRs. Thus, InP sells its owned spectrum and charges a price, i.e.,

4.1 Radio Resource Allocation with Single InP

47

pc (per unit of VR c). This spectrum is bought by the MVNOs to serve its users. The goal lies in revenue maximization for the InP by setting the appropriate price to satisfy the demand of MVNOs. Then, the network utility for an InP can be stated by:

UI (x, p) = xvpv,
v∈V

(4.4)

where xv = k∈Kv c∈C xvc,k, ∀V represents the number of VRs required by the MVNO v, and pv represents its price charged by InP.
On the other hand, MVNO aims to reduce its cost and serve its users in a
satisfactory manner. Thus, the utility of an MVNO v is given by:

4.1.2 Problem Formulation

The objective is to augment the aggregate utility of the framework from the point of view of both InP and MVNOs. Therefore, our goal is to augment the income achieved by InP while at the same time taking care of the requests of MVNOs. Then, the VR allocation problem is given as follows:

(4.6)
(4.7) (4.8) (4.9) (4.10)

In P1, the constraint (4.7) ensures that any user k will be given at most one VR c from the InP. Constraint (4.8) is considered as isolation provisioning constraint with minimum rate requirement for each MVNOs user. The allocation indicator is given by constraint (4.9). Finally, (4.10) the pricing constraint is presented. Problem P1 is an integer linear programming and a combinatorial problem, and thus ﬁnding a solution incurs heavy computational complexity. Therefore it becomes challenging for a large sized network [2, 7].

48

4 Network Slicing: Radio Resource Allocation

The goal is to achieve a solution that has the properties of low complexity and can be implemented in a distributed fashion. To achieve such goals, matching game is utilized to convert the problem P1 to a matching game. Next, we elaborate about the matching game used by the authors to ﬁnd an efﬁcient solution.

4.1.3 Solution
Matching theory has the capability to achieve a solution with aforementioned properties, thus it can be used for the stated allocation problem. It can overcome the challenges faced by optimization-based solution especially for combinatorial problems [6]. In matching theory, players have the ability to characterize its individual utilities relying on his local data. This helps in achieving a distributed solution that can be implemented in a self-organizing manner for the allocation problem. In this work, the authors have used the matching theory framework with two-sided preferences to address the proposed problem. This approach divides the players into two sets. Then, each member of a set ranks a subset of the individuals or members from the other set based on its local information or utility. Then, the goal of the VR allocation problem is to derive a solution for ﬁnding the best MVNO users for the all VRs that are owned by the InP. Note that by using matching theory, both sides can build their preferences to rank each other that only require local information available at each side.

Matching Game: Prerequisites

Matching theory has been successfully used in solving similar allocation problem as the stated VR allocation problem [13, 14, 16]. Based on matching theory, the authors formulate the VR allocation as a matching game problem, and design the utility of each player belonging to a speciﬁc set. Note that in this work, MVNOs users and InP owned VRs are the two distinct sets. Finally a low-complexity algorithm is presented by the authors that achieves a stable solution. Stability is a key solution concept for the matching games and will be discussed in the following subsection.
In this work from constraint (4.7), authors assume that an MVNO user k uses a single VR. However, the SLA should be met in order to use a VR, i.e., constraint (4.8). Furthermore, they consider that a VR can be allotted to multiple users until the required rate is guaranteed in order to enhance VR reuse efﬁciency. Thus, the designed game corresponds to a one-to-many matching game and is formally stated as:

(K, C, K, C).

(4.11)

where K { k}k∈K states the preference ranking of a user. Similarly, C { c}c∈C states the VRs. Then, a matching μ is deﬁned formally as follows.

4.1 Radio Resource Allocation with Single InP

49

Deﬁnition 4.1 A matching μ is deﬁned by a function from the set K ∪ N into the set of elements of K ∪ N such that:
1. |μ(k)| ≤ 1 and μ(k) ∈ N , 2. |μ(n)| ≤ qn and μ(n) ∈ K ∪ φ, 3. μ(k) = n if and only if k is in μ(n),
where μ(k) = {n} ⇔ μ(n) = {k} for ∀n ∈ N, ∀k ∈ K and |μ(.)| represents the cardinality of the outcome produced by the matching μ(.). The ﬁrst two conditions express that the matching type, i.e., one-to-many type, i.e., a UE k can join only one InP n whereas an InP n can accommodate multiple UEs up to qn, given the SLA is guaranteed from the constraints (4.7) and (4.8) of P1. qc denotes the set of users that can be admitted on a VR c (i.e., quota) such that the required SLA is met by using the VR. Furthermore, there are additionally situations in which user k is not suitable for any VR c due to breaching of requirement constraint (4.7) which is represented by μ(c) = φ.

Matching Game: Preference Proﬁle

To build the preference proﬁle, interaction between the InP and MVNOs is required. It is assumed by the authors that the InP broadcasts its desired price for a VR initially. Then, each MVNOs also responds by stating its demand based on the users associated with an MVNO. As stated earlier, each MVNOs goal is to provide service to its users at the minimum price. On the other hand, InP aims to maximize its revenue by setting the right price to satisfy the demand of MVNOs while guarantees the contracts agreements, i.e., minimum required bandwidth.
A preference proﬁle is built by each player of both sides to assess one another. In the proposed game, local information will be used by each side to build their respective preference proﬁles. For the MVNO users, the preference proﬁle is built using the following preference function:

U k(c) = max{( rvc,k − rvm,kin), 0}

(4.12)

This function represents the aim that an MVNO wants to achieve, i.e., provide best service at least cost that is required to be paid to InP. Equation (4.12) also reﬂects the feasibility condition as stated in constraint (4.8). It states that in case a VR c is unable to fulﬁll the demand requirement for a user k, then a zero value is given by (4.12) and is not considered in the preference proﬁle or ranking. Note that each MVNO V will select its best user k using the following function on a VR c.

U v(c) = max U k(c)
k

(4.13)

Moreover, a user k builds its preference proﬁle Pk by ranking the set of VRs in an increasing order, i.e., the cheaper the cost of VR, the better its position in ranking

50

4 Network Slicing: Radio Resource Allocation

which implies, a VR c ∈ C which has the lowest cost through (4.12) will be the ﬁrst preferred VR c from the set of VRs, i.e., c ∈ C. For a user k this is given by:

c k c , ∀c, c ∈ C.

(4.14)

Thus user k will like to use VR c for performing its transmission. Finally, it is to
be noted that preference proﬁles Pk for all users k are maintained by their respective MVNOs.
Similarly, a VR c also requires a preference proﬁle to rank users k ∈ Kv. InP helps to build this preference proﬁle on behalf of each VR c which is given by Pc. It is given by the following function:

U c(N ) = mkavx{|Nkv | : rNc kv > rNmiknv },

(4.15)

where N denotes the set of accepted users k associated with any MVNO v which can be allocated by the VR c while maintaining the SLA as follows:

N ⊆ v∈V Kv,

(4.16)

Similarly, rNc kv denotes the rate for these users, and rNmiknv represents the minimum requirement of all users.
As indicated by (4.15), a VR c picks multiple users N to form a subset with the end goal that achievable data rate accomplished by the subset of N is more than the SLA, i.e., required rate of all users. The goal of the designed function is to maximize to choose a set with maximum number of users in N . Note this enables the InP to produce the greatest income (4.4) while at the same time abiding the SLAs between MVNOs and InP. The largest subset in terms of number of members is ranked highest and is the most favored among all the possible subsets.
In order to calculate the preference proﬁles of all users, communication of some information is required in the network. For the InP side, it requires to know the minimum required data rate for each MVNO user, which can be sent with some signaling through the control channel. Similarly, the MVNOs need to know the prices of the VRs to evaluate all available VRs. Nonetheless, signaling just associated with sending these values once from the VNOs to the InP, which is relatively small [23]. After building the preference proﬁles by each side, next, the aim is to design an efﬁcient solution to match players of both sides with each other.

Matching Game: VR Allocation Scheme
In this section, the authors present the proposed VR allocation scheme based on the aforementioned game. The goal of the proposed algorithm is to ﬁnd a stable allocation, i.e., key solution concept in matching theory [5, 22]. Then, the stability of matching game is deﬁned formally as follows.

Deﬁnition 4.2 A matching μ is stable if there exists no blocking pair (k, c), where k ∈ K, c ∈ C, such that c k μ(k) and k c μ(c), where μ(k) and μ(c) represent, respectively, the current matched partners of k and c.
The output of the algorithm is the assignment vector of users and the pseudocode is given in Algorithm 1. The proposed algorithm is ensured to converge to a stable allocation as it is a variation of “deferred-acceptance algorithm” [22].
The algorithm has three stages, namely the introduction stage, the matching stage, and the VR allocation stage. In the initialization stage, local information is acquired by both the sides to build preference proﬁle and perform the ranking operation. It begins by each MVNO presenting its demand for each user, i.e., rvm,kin, ∀Km, V. In light of it, the InP communicates its available resources and the relating costs for utilization. In response to this, each MVNO user builds its preference proﬁle Pk. So also, the InP builds its proﬁle for each VR c, i.e., Pr for all the MVNO users (lines 1–3). In stage two matching stage, the best MVNO user k receives a proposal for each VR c as indicated by its preference proﬁle Pk

52

4 Network Slicing: Radio Resource Allocation

(lines 7–8). This results in either of the two cases, case 1: If (4.12) is fulﬁlled, i.e., MVNO user k has a nonnegative utility for VR c. At that point, user k accepts the proposal temporarily, if its unmatched, i.e., μ(k)(t) = φ (lines 9–12). In the event that its already matched μ(k)(t) = φ, then a comparison is made between the current match and the new proposal. The proposal that is higher positioned in its preference proﬁle is accepted while the lower positioned is rejected (line 13 and 15). In case 2, the proposing VR c will be dismissed as it doesn’t meet (4.12). All the rejected VRs will at last be included in the rejected list, i.e., the set Lc(t), at iteration t (Line 19). Then, using the rejected list all players update their preference proﬁle. This implies the removal of all MVNO users k from the Pc(t) by VR c, and similarly MVNO users also remove c from Pk(t) (lines 20–22). Note that the matching process is an iterative process which is completed when the solution is found, i.e., a stable solution between the two sides (line 27). The process converges when two consecutive matching remain same (line 27). The last stage is the VR allocation stage, in this stage the matched MVNO users are permitted to use on the apportioned VRs (lines 28–29). Finally, the authors also provide the convergence and proof for Pareto optimality as follows.
Proposition 4.1 Algorithm 1 converges to a stable point as it is variant of deferred acceptance algorithm [22].
Proof The proof of Theorem 4.1 can be found in [[11], Theorem 1].
Similarly, they also deﬁne the Pareto optimality as follows.
Deﬁnition 4.3 A matching μ results in a weak Pareto optimal solution if there exists no other matching μ that can achieve a better utility, where the inequality is component-wise and strict for a pair (k, c).
Theorem 4.1 Algorithm 1 produces a weak Pareto optimal solution for the InP [11].
Proof The proof of Theorem 4.1 can be found in [[11], Theorem 2].

4.1.4 Simulation Setup and Results
In this section, simulations results performed by authors are presented. They carry out simulations under different topologies and situations to exhibit the execution and adequacy of the VR allocation algorithm. The network topology includes one BS owned by an InP, with MVNO users randomly located inside a circle of radius of r = 500 m. For their simulations, they considered a network with only 3 MVNOs each with 5 associated users as shown in Fig. 4.2. Furthermore, they cater two cases when the InP possesses C = 5 and 10 OFDMA sub-channels, every one of which has an aggregate data transfer capacity of 180 KHz. Moreover, detailed wireless system parameters such as channel gains and BS power are stated in Table 4.2 [11].

Additionally, the presented results are averaged over a large number of independent simulation runs.
In Fig. 4.3, the required number of iteration to achieve convergence of Algorithm 1 is presented for different number of users in the system. Algorithm 1 achieves the convergence point when both the sides reach a stable point and don’t plan to stray from their present allocation. It can be deduced from the graph that under all situations, the scheme achieves convergence after limited number of iterations, i.e., less than 4 for the two situations when C = 10 and 5 with 10 users. Besides, take note of that, for a lesser number of VRs in the network, the convergence is achieved earlier. The reason behind this is that VRs are limited and no more users are allowed to be admitted to abide constraint (4.8).
In Fig. 4.4, the achievable throughput is presented versus the number of users in the network. To perform this simulation, number of users in the network were increased to observe the average throughput. It was found that the throughput increases with users linearly until enough number of users are not there in the system. When the number of users in the system become adequately vast especially for the case of C = 5, constraint (4.8) needs to be protected by allowing only some

users which results in saturation of throughput. Besides, for the situation when there exists more VRs, i.e., 10, the throughput increments further. Note that the revenue of an InP increases with more number of users.
This work proposed an efﬁcient resource allocation scheme for the MVNO users by employing the matching theory. They formulate the resource allocation problem and propose a stable and decentralized solution for the proposed problem.

4.2 Radio Resource Allocation with Multi-InP

55

Stability was proved and it was shown that the scheme generates a Pareto optimal solution. However, the proposed model assumed static demands and prices and did not consider dynamic isolation and prices in this work. Next, we present another scheme in [12] in which dynamic demands and prices are considered.

4.2 Radio Resource Allocation with Multi-InP
In the previous section, we discussed about the resource allocation in a single InP environment. However, in a practical system, we have a group of InPs available in a service area that can serve a group of MVNOs and its users. In a multi-InP environment, these InPs can enhance the resource sharing by servicing MVNOs by giving them isolated resources (i.e., slices) formed via the physical owned resources. These virtual resources can be shared among multiple MVNOs which can enhance the ﬂexibility of a service area. The challenge in such a setting is to perform resource allocation in such a manner that the performance of the service area consisting of multiple InPs and MVNOs is enhanced. Some related works on this speciﬁc issue can be found in [3, 21, 26].
The work in [12] also addresses the problem of resource allocation in a speciﬁc service area that contains multiple InPs. In this work, service selection and resource purchasing is performed in a multi-InP environment. Service selection allows a number of users to be associated with an MVNO and resource purchasing requires the resources of an InP to be purchased by the MVNOs to serve its associated users.
In summary, the key novelty and contributions include:
• They formulate the service selection and resource purchasing problems for a multi-cell WNV. Moreover, the problem considers utility maximization for both the InPs and MVNOs subject to the service contract agreements between InPs and MVNOs.
• They develop a low-complexity algorithm called the hierarchal matching algorithm which can achieve a near-optimal solution.

4.2.1 System Model
The authors consider a service area that contains a set of N base stations (BSs) which are owned by different MVNOs. Moreover, in their model, they assume that each physical resources is orthogonal to other InPs, i.e., no inter InP interference is considered. Furthermore, there are M MVNOs that require service from the InPs in the service area. These MVNOs then provide service to a set of Km users (UEs). Figure 4.5 illustrates the system model (Table 4.3).

4.2.2 Problem Formulation

The goal in this work is to maximize the performance in a service area consisting of UEs, MVNOs, and InPs. Therefore, for each UE k ∈ K its problem is deﬁned as follows:

UE : min.
xk,m∈{0,1}

m∈M xk,mβmM dk,

(4.18)

s.t. m∈M xk,m = 1,

(4.19)

where xk,m ∈ X and xk,m = 1 represents the UE k wants to buy service from MVNO m for its demand dk. Therefore, each UE aims on minimizing (4.18) for its demand. Moreover, constraint (4.19) ensures that a UE is served by one MVNO.
Then, an MVNO m aims to maximize its beneﬁts by buying resources for UEs and determining the required channels at minimum cost. The MVNO m problem is given as:

MVNO : max.
x˜k,m ,y˜msn,n ∈{0,1}

k∈K x˜k,mβmM dk−

(4.20) (4.21) (4.22)

where x˜k,m ∈ X˜ and y˜ms ,n ∈ Y˜ represent the service selection and resource purchasing variables, respectively. Formally, they are given as follows:

58

x˜k,m = 1, if UE k is selected by MVNO m for service, 0, otherwise.

y˜ms ,n =

1, 0,

if MVNO m aims to buy slice sn of InP n, otherwise.

Here, lk,n represents the required channels for ensuring the demand dk. Finally, constraint (4.21) represents that k is associated with one MVNO and constraint (4.22) restricts an InP n to over-allocate resources.
Then, the InP solves the following problem to maximize its beneﬁt:

(4.23) (4.24) (4.25)

ymsn,n =

1, 0,

if MVNO m is selected by InP N for resource purchasing, otherwise.

Moreover, the InP sells resource based on the requirement of an MVNO which is represented by the demand dm from the MVNO m (i.e., dm = k∈Km dk). Furthermore, (4.23) represents the objective of InP in terms of its beneﬁts. Constraint (4.24) protects the InP to perform the resource violation and the constraint in (4.25) represents the contract agreement that is considered between MVNO and InP. This is also considered as the isolation constraint in the WNV.
The designed optimization problem turns out to be a mix integer linear programming problem [2] and solving this problem becomes challenging due to its combinatorial nature. To solve this problem, the authors have designed a hierarchical matching mechanism which can solve the hierarchical (i.e., two-level) WNV problem.

In the hierarchical matching mechanism, two levels are considered. In the ﬁrst level (low-level), UE and MVNO play a matching game to ﬁnd the UEs that are successful in service selection, while in the second level (high-level) MVNO and InP decide

the resource purchasing. Two games using two-sided matching games are designed to achieve this objective. In the high-level, InP and MVNOs act as the two sides of the matching game and represent the vendor and buyers in this game, respectively. In the lower level, MVNOs and UEs play the second game in which the MVNOs play the vendors’ role and UEs act as the buyers in this game. As a one-to-many matching game is formulated, then, a buyer can be associated with a single vendor while vendor can have multiple buyers matched to it. Formally, it can be given by the tuple (B, V , qv, B , V ). Where B { b}b∈B and V { v}v∈V denote the preference relation sets of the buyers B and vendors V , respectively.
Deﬁnition 4.4 A matching μ is deﬁned by a function from the set B ∪ V into the set of elements of B ∪ V such that:
(1) |μ(b)| ≤ 1 and μ(b) ∈ V , (2) |μ(v)| ≤ qv and μ(v) ∈ 2|B| ∪ φ, where qv is the quota of v, (3) μ(b) = v if and only if b is in μ(v).
In the hierarchical matching mechanism, ﬁrst, the low-level game is solved to ﬁnd the set of UEs that will be served by the MVNOs. Then, the high-level game is played between the InPs and the MVNOs. In the low-level game, the UEs rank all MVNOs based on the their local information which is reﬂected by the following preference function to build its preference proﬁle Pkl .

Ukbl (mn) = βmMn dk, ∀mn.

(4.26)

Similarly, each MVNO mn also build its preference proﬁle Pml n by ranking all UEs based on the following function:

Umn (k) = max(βmMn dk − βnI lk,n, 0), ∀k.

(4.27)

Note that, here, MVNO mn requires to calculate the required channels by UE k lk,n to fulﬁll its demand dk. Then, the goal is to ﬁnd a service selection scheme via matching.
After solving the low-level game, the high-level game is played for resource
purchasing. To evaluate the two sides in this game, here also preferences proﬁles are built by the two sides, i.e., MVNOs and INPs given by Pmun and Pn, respectively. The MVNOs use the following function to rank InPs in this game.

Umbhn (n) = βnI dmn , ∀n.

(4.28)

where dmn is the demand on each MVNO m posed by its accepted UEs for an InP n and given by

dmn =

dk .

k∈μ(mn)

Finally, the InP also ranks all MVNOs by using the following function. The goal is to maximize its beneﬁt by allocating its slices to MVNOs

Unsh (mn) = k∈μ(mn) log(Rnsn,k) + ωβnI γmn , ∀mn.

(4.30)

Hierarchical Matching (HM) Game Algorithm
Once the preferences proﬁle is built, the nest goal is to develop a stable matching algorithm for the designed hierarchical problem. However, designing a solution for a hierarchical game is challenging as more strict conditions need to be followed in order to achieve stability. Therefore, in this work, the authors have proved not only the stability in each stage of the hierarchal structure but also a concept of group stability which is a more strong condition when achieving stability.
The main challenge in a hierarchical game is that any change in the low-level player’s strategy will affect the strategy of the players in the high-level. Therefore, convergence and stability cannot be achieved until the player’s strategy at the lowlevel is ﬁxed. This is achieved by forming a group and achieving a group stability for every InP n, i.e., Gn, ∀n ∈ N . Moreover, the game is played in a sequential manner as shown in Fig. 4.6. Finally, the detailed pseudocode of the novel stable matching algorithm is presented in Algorithm 2 by the authors.

4.2.4 Performance Analysis

4 Network Slicing: Radio Resource Allocation

To simulate the proposal, the authors consider the standard parameters of cellular technologies following the system guidelines [4]. Moreover, other parameters used for this simulation are described in Table 4.4. Furthermore, the presented results are averaged over 500 number of independent simulation runs.
For comparison purposes, the proposed approach was evaluated against two schemes [26]. The ﬁrst scheme was a ﬁxed sharing scheme (FS), in which equal number of channels are reserved for all MVNOs. The second scheme is a general sharing scheme (GS). In this scheme, each InP performs channel allocation for all users in the network. Such a scheme has been used for channel allocation in some existing works such as [3, 21].
In Fig. 4.7, the authors calculated the average sum-rate for different network size under different schemes. It can be inferred that sum-rate increases with the number of users in the system. This however saturates as the number of users in the system increases as each InP has limited channel band (i.e., 1.4 MHz). Moreover, the proposed scheme closely performs when compared to the GS scheme and achieves

Next in Fig. 4.11, the slice size for each MVNO is observed. For this simulation, three InP-BS, ﬁve MVNOs, and a network size of 40 UEs were considered. In this ﬁgure, the slice size provided to each MVNO by all InP-BSs with system bandwidth 5 MHz was observed after executing the proposed algorithm. It can be seen that MVNO 2 is allocated the complete bandwidth (i.e., 25 channels) of InP-BS 3 as a slice, 80 % bandwidth from InP-BS 2 and 68 % from InP-BS 1 as a slice. This is based on its demand for each InP-BS from MVNO 2. Similarly only MVNO 1 has received the remaining 20% bandwidth of InP-BS 1 as a slice. Note that both InP-BS 1 and 3 have allocated all its channels to MVNOs whereas InP-BS

2 still have additional channels. This is due to the fact that under this scenario, no MVNO has further demand from InP-BS 2. Then, the authors rerun the simulation (considering the same simulation setup) by increasing the network bandwidth to 10 MHz. The results are shown in Fig. 4.12. Here, it was observed that MVNO 2 is allocated a larger slice (additional bandwidth) from InP-BS 3 while the slice size from other InP-BS remains the same. Note here that as the slice size from other InP-BS remains the same in both scenarios, there exist no more demands from this MVNO toward these InPs. Moreover, MVNO 1 is also allocated additional bandwidth (larger slice) from InP-BS1 and InP-BS 3. Similarly MVNO 3 is also received a share of bandwidth (slice) from InP-BS 3. However, other MVNOs are not allocated any slice. From this it can be inferred that the size of allocated slice depends upon the MVNOs demands and preference of InP-BS. For instance, in this simulation scenario, three MVNOs (MVNO 1, MVNO 2, and MVNO 3) required a slice from InP-BS 3. However, InP-BS 3 ﬁrst served MVNO 2, then MVNO 1, and ﬁnally MVNO 3 following its preference proﬁle. Finally in Fig. 4.13, we generated

100 random simulation instances with bandwidth 10 MHz and presented the average slice size allocated to each MVNO.
Next, in Fig. 4.8, the average sum-rate vs network size with varying number of InP-BS for the HM scheme is shown. It is inferred that as we increase the InP-BS density from 1 to 10, more opportunities are available for UEs due to increase in number of channel per serving area. Thus the average sum-rate increases with both the BS density and network size. However, when signiﬁcant channels are available to fulﬁll all UEs demand, the average rate saturates, i.e., when |Nj | > 9 for a network size |K| = 40. The average sum-rate increases both with the network size and InP-BS density because of more resources availability in the service area.
Figure 4.9 states that the increase in average sum-rate of HM scheme when both the network size and InP-BS bandwidth increases until it gets saturated. For this simulation, the InP-BS bandwidth is increased from 1.4 to 20 MHz (i.e., 6–100 channels). Finally, the average iterations of HM scheme are shown in Fig. 4.10. It can be seen that convergence is achieved under all scenarios in a limited number of iterations.

4.3 Summary

4 Network Slicing: Radio Resource Allocation

In this chapter, we discussed about two proposals pertaining to the radio resource allocation problem in wireless network slicing. The ﬁrst proposal considered a single InP environment in which an efﬁcient and distributed scheme was designed to allocate radio resources to MVNOs users. The second proposal handles a more practical problem in which a service area consisting of multiple InPs, MVNOs, and users is considered. In this work, two important problems of service selection and resource purchasing are solved. In service selection, users choose an MVNO for services and in resource purchasing MVNOs buy radio resources from multiple InPs in a given service area.

Chapter 5
Network Slicing: Radio Resource Allocation Using Non-orthogonal Multiple Access

5.1 Introduction
Virtualization of a network is considered as one of the essential formative viewpoints in the pushing toward ﬁfth generation (5G) cellular networks. Many inherent beneﬁts such as enhanced data rates, spectrum/energy efﬁciency, capacity, and lower latency are expected to be achieved for higher quality of experience [11, 12, 16].
However, the unprecedented growth in data trafﬁc and the tsunami of mobile devices in the existing networks demands to consider spectrum efﬁciency and massive connectivity in 5G networks. Also, the greatest limitation of the existing employed access scheme, i.e., orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme (i.e., the OFDMA scheme) is that the number of users that can simultaneously occupy the spectrum resources is restricted by the number of available spectrum resources, i.e., subchannels, resource blocks (RBs). Recently, a new promising technology has been under consideration for solving the challenges of OMA-based schemes. Nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been viewed as a key enabler for catering the inconveniences of OFDMA scheme in 5G networks [14, 15]. NOMA takes advantage of the resource gain differences through which it allows multiple users to be scheduled on a single spectrum resource. Thus, the NOMA technique can accommodate higher number of users in the network when compared to traditional OMA schemes. However, users that are scheduled over the same spectrum resource create inter-user interference over the spectrum resource. This problem can be solved by using the successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique at the receiver. However, reaping the beneﬁts of NOMA requires meeting signiﬁcant challenges in terms of resource and power assignment [7, 9].

5.2 System Model and Problem Formulation

Consider the downlink of the system model illustrated in Fig. 5.1, which consists of
a single cell with a macro base station (MBS) [7]. The third party service provider
such as infrastructure provider (InP) owns and manages the spectrum and MBS. The
virtual network services using individual contracts are provided by InP to slices set N . The set Un of users are provided with services by a slice n ∈ N . Let the set of all users is denoted by U ∪|nN=1| Un. Further, the system bandwidth C that consists of Ω RBs is owned by the InP.
In model of [7], the NOMA cluster is formed by a set of users that are scheduled
for a non-orthogonal set of same resource blocks. The set of resource blocks on
which the NOMA cluster operates is orthogonal to other NOMA clusters resource blocks. Along with this, the number of users ranges from 2 to |U | in a NOMA cluster. Apart from this, δk (where 1 ≤ δk ≤ Ω) represents the k-th cluster allocated
resource blocks. Let the clusters set, the active users set that are grouped into k-th cluster, and maximum MBS transmission power budge are represented by S, Sk, and PT respectively. Pjn and hjn = χjn /D(djn ) denote the allocated power to user jn and complex channel coefﬁcient between MBS and user jn. Where χjn , D(djn ), and djn represent the gain of the Rayleigh fading channel, path-loss function, and distance between the MBS and the user jn respectively. Let the symbol of user jn

that is transmitted is represented by xjn . In a k-th cluster, the MBS signal that is received by user jn is given by:

yjkn = hjn Pjn xjkn +

hjn Pim xikm + zjn ,

i=j |i∈Sk

(5.1)

where zjn denotes the noise. Within a cluster, all its users can have access to the resource blocks which might result in interference among the users. Every user will use SIC on the received superimposed signals [5]. Generally, lower power levels are assigned to users with high channel gain. The signals with lower channel power are recovered in SIC decoding later than the signals with high power levels. In a similar fashion, the signals of the users with lower power levels are recovered through treatment of the lower power level signals of other users as noise in SIC decoding [1, 5].
Optimally, the decoding order of the SIC should follow increasing channel gains normalized by noise. More speciﬁcally, the user jn ∈ Sk receiver can have the ability to cancel interference of other user im ∈ Sk having channel gain |him |2/zim < |hjn |2/zjn . The clustering variable βjkn is deﬁned as follows:

βjkn =

1, 0,

if user jn is grouped into cluster k, otherwise.

Thus, the data rate for a user jn in the downlink NOMA k-th cluster is given as follows:

Rjkn = δkB log2

where Ijkn denote the interference perceived at user jn ∈ Un due to coexisting other users on the same k-th cluster.

In NOMA, the users with higher channel gains are the only source of interfer-

ence. For example, consider a cluster of two users that follow

.

The

user

1 ﬁrst performs the decoding of x2, then performs its subtraction from the signal yk,

and then ﬁnally performs the decoding of the signal x1. Other than that, the user 2

5 Network Slicing: Radio Resource Allocation Using Non-orthogonal Multiple. . .

Obtaining a better resource allocation along with isolation in WNV is one of the major challenges in its implementation. WNV enables the InP to create slices of physical resources. These slices are isolated which make it possible to make changes in any one of the slices without affecting the others [11]. At the physical resource level isolation, implementation of the isolation can be performed using different techniques. One approach is to assign each slice a ﬁxed amount of predeﬁned physical resources while in other cases, dynamic sharing is done and no restriction on the resource access is made. However, in dynamic sharing, the isolation is achieved using contract agreements [17]. This work considered the dynamic sharing scheme that is based on guaranteeing the service contract agreements between the InP and MVNOs by a minimum data rate [4, 17]. Let the minimum data rate of the n-th slice is represented by Rnmin. Then the isolation constraint that must be fulﬁlled in creating NOMA clusters by InP is given by:

βjkn Rjkn ≥ Rnmin, ∀n ∈ N .

5.2.1 Problem Formulation

The authors in [7] considered the network sum-rate objective and a weight factor ωjn is used for user jn to enable adjustment of the priorities of the users. In the downlink NOMA, the joint problem of resource block allocation, power assignment problem,
and user clustering for weighted sum-rate maximization can be formulated as:

User Clustering RB Allocation

Power Assignment
Optimization framework

where the power assignment vector is given by P {Pjn }, ∀jn ∈ U , the RB allocation vector is represented by δ {δk}, ∀k ∈ S, and the user clustering matrix is represented by β {βjkn }, ∀jn ∈ U , k ∈ S, respectively. The constraints C1, C2, C3, and C4 are used to represent the total power constraint, ensure slice isolation requirement in NOMA clustering, ensure assignment of a user to at most a single
cluster, and to ensure that at least two users are grouped into NOMA cluster. The
constraint C5 denotes the spectrum resource constraint on a downlink. The problem of (5.5) is formulated as a mixed-integer non-convex optimization
problem. For tackling the above problem, the decoupling of resource allocation and
user clustering has been performed. Then a joint solution that involves the iterative
solution of resource allocation and user clustering is proposed as shown in Fig. 5.2.

5.3 Solution Approach
5.3.1 Matching Game for User Clustering (NOMA Clustering)
The working of NOMA is assisted by users grouping with different channel gains over a resource block. The users are divided into three categories according to channel gains, i.e., strong users, normal users, and weak users.
Users Classiﬁcation
First of all, the classiﬁcation of the users has been performed in this section and then total clusters in a network are computed. The reason for using this intuition is due to the fact that a single NOMA cluster has users with different channel gains. The scheme used for clustering and classiﬁcation has two steps. The initial step is the classiﬁcation phase that is done through the sorting of users in descending

7: Step 2: Cluster formation based on classiﬁcation: 8: Input: |S| = 0, K = {A, B, C} 9: |S| = maxi |Ki | 10: Output: |S|, i.e., number of required NOMA clusters

order (Line 4). Following users classiﬁcation, the clustering of users into three different groups is performed. The next step 2 is the computation of the number of required clusters utilizing the output of the previous step. The number of clusters S is taken equal to maximum cardinality after computing the cardinality of all classes. Following the computation of the clusters and users classes, the next step is the grouping of users into clusters.
This subproblem can be solved by assuming that power level assignment of every user and number of resource blocks given to each cluster are given. The users clustering problem is as follows:

(5.6)

Finding the solution of the problem in (5.6) is NP-hard for a large number of clusters and users due to its combinatorial nature [10]. Therefore it’s desirable to ﬁnd the solution of the problem (5.6) in a distributed manner. Problem (5.6) is

solved using a matching game that does not consider the C1 constraint. Similarly the constraint C4 is also relaxed through allowing a single user in a cluster.

Matching Game with Externalities for User Clustering
The execution of cluster formation and user classiﬁcation results in the user classes and the required number of clusters at iteration t. Then, for a given number of clusters, a user clustering is carried out. This section uses a matching theory for performing clustering of users. The reason for using matching game is because of its ability to solve problems that have combinatorial nature [6, 8, 10]. The distributed nature of the matching game is exploited in WNV and NOMA to enable complexity reduction of centralized approach on InP. Additionally, matching theory enables players to perform utility deﬁnition through its local information. In this model, the sets of agents are the MVNO users deﬁned by the set, U , and the clusters deﬁned by the set, S. The preference proﬁle Pk of the kth cluster is complete, transitive, and strict. From constraint C3 in (5.6), it is clear that a user can be associated with one cluster. On the other hand, different users can be associated with a single cluster. Therefore, user preference proﬁle Pu has been deﬁned over the clusters S. As the preference ranking of a user j is affected by other users in the same cluster, therefore, one-to-many matching given by tuple (U , S, U , S ) is considered. The matching is deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 5.1 A matching β is deﬁned as a function from the set U ∪ S into the set U ∪ S which satisﬁes for all k ∈ S and j ∈ U [7]:
1. |β(j )| ≤ 1 and β(j ) ∈ S ∪ φ, 2. |β(k)| ≤ qk and β(k) ∈ 2U ∪ φ, 3. If j ∈ β(k) then β(j ) = k, 4. If β(j ) ∈ k for cluster k then β(k) = j ,
where qk and |β(.)| represent the kth cluster quota and matching outcome β(.) cardinality, respectively. In Deﬁnition 7.1, the ﬁrst two conditions denote C4 and C3 in (5.6). Where qk ≤ |U | denote the kth cluster total quota. The β(j ) = φ gives indication that j has not been matched to any cluster. Similarly, β(k) = φ means that no user is matched to the kth cluster.
Both sides require to perform ranking of each other in the formulated game of [7] through preference proﬁles. On the other side, the users preference proﬁlers are affected by offered resources to a cluster along with other users in that cluster. This type of interdependences in matching theory is called as externalities which has signiﬁcant impact on the design of the proposed solution. An agent might change its preference order continuously because of these externalities in response to other agents activities. Therefore, care should be taken during the design of solution based on matching game to attain convergence. Each user computes data rate that can be achieved for every cluster and then place them in descending order to build preference proﬁle (Pj , ∀j ∈ U ). Moreover, the minimum data rate requirement

76

5 Network Slicing: Radio Resource Allocation Using Non-orthogonal Multiple. . .

over a slice has been transformed by relaxing to a user minimum data rate, i.e.,

game.

Therefore,

utility

of

a user can be written as:

Uj (k, β) = max(Rjk, Rjmin), ∀k ∈ S.

(5.7)

Thus, the preference relation j for any user j is deﬁned over the set of clusters S which can be given as follows:

(k, β) j (k , β ) ⇔ Uj (k, β) > Uj (k , β ).

(5.8)

Similarly, each cluster k aims to choose a set of users that can maximize its utility. Therefore, the cluster uses the following utility to create its preference proﬁle (Pk)

Uk(j, β) = max(Rjs − Rjmin, 0), ∀j ∈ U ,

(5.9)

Each cluster k as per (5.9) performs user selection whose data rate requirements of minimum data rate can be fulﬁlled and to maximize the cluster data rate. The user is ranked least and denoted by zero preference in case if the demand of the user cannot be met, i.e., constraint C5. A preference relation k for a cluster k is deﬁned as follows:

(j, β) s (j , β ) ⇔ Uk(j, β) > Uk(j , β ).

(5.10)

After deﬁning preference proﬁles along with the matching game, a stable clustering for a game is deﬁned while taking into the account the externalities effect. It is clear from (5.9) and (5.7) that preferences are a function of the current matching β and interference of higher SINR users that affects other users performance. To tackle such type of externalities, a scheme is discussed in the next subsection.
In the proposed game, any user j grouped with users of same cluster k will induce interference on other users that are grouped in the same cluster in case its gain is higher than other users of the same cluster. Apart from that, a user might change its preference order due to action of other users that reside in the same cluster. The situation might produce a case where the ﬁnal clustering will never be attained. To tackle this issue, the proposed algorithm uses the broadcast of initial network information by InP. It is assumed that users will sent such type of information to InP during the initialization step. Each user can compute the users set that have higher channel gains using this type of information. The users that are of the same class are only taken into consideration. The externality set by Cj is as follows:

Cj =

j ∈ U : |hj |2 > |hj |2 , j, j ∈ A

where A denote same class from Algorithm 1. The users of the same class that have higher gain than user j is selected using (5.11). The purpose of this type of externality set is to enable restriction on users of same class to do grouping within same cluster.

Clustering Algorithm
To determine a stable clustering, the initial step is to deﬁne the game blocking pair. The Gale–Shapley style algorithm does not apply to the game because of the externalities in proposed matching game. Therefore, the blocking pair is designed for game through the algorithm as follows.

78

5 Network Slicing: Radio Resource Allocation Using Non-orthogonal Multiple. . .

Deﬁnition 5.2 A matching β is blocked by a pair of players (j, k) if there exists a pair (j, k) such that, j k β(k), k j β(j ), and β(k) ∈/ Cj .
The intuition used in Deﬁnition 5.2 is: Whenever a cluster k is preferred by a user j compared to its assigned cluster β(j ) which has no user conﬂicts (i.e., β(k) ∈/ Cj ). Apart from that the cluster k preferred to accept j , then a blocking pair can be formed by cluster k and user j through deviation from assigned matching. The existence of stable matching is characterized by the absence of blocking pair. Moreover, a condition for attaining the stability is the creation of newly generated pair of agents must not undermine the existing pairs stability. Using this condition will allow the preference proﬁles of already matched pairs of agents to remain unchanged due to the creation of new pair of agents.
Algorithm 2 presents the pseudocode of the proposed user clustering scheme proposed by Ho et al. [7]. The detailed working of this scheme has been described in [7]. Moreover, the authors have also proved that this scheme converges to a stable solution that has no blocking pairs. Formally, it is stated as follows.
Theorem 5.1 A convergence to stable allocation is achieved by Algorithm 2 [7].
Proof The proof is presented in Theorem 1 of [7].
Once the user clustering problem is solved, the aim is to ﬁnd the appropriate resources required to meet the requirements of each cluster. Therefore, next, the authors solve the resource allocation problem for each cluster.

5.3.2 Resource Allocation

There is no polynomial algorithm to solve problem (5.12) because of its integer

programming nature. The problem is simpliﬁed through relaxing discrete variables δk into real numbers in the interval [1, Ω]. The simpliﬁed problem is now a

concave problem due to the fact that constraints C2 and objective have the form of

The common scheme used to solve the problem considering the context of resource blocks allocation of LTE involves the mapping of the continuous solutions in Algorithm 3 to the largest previous integer, i.e., δ∗ = δ∗ , where x denotes the largest integer not more than x.

Centralized SCA-Based Power Assignment with AGM Approximation
In connection with the above discussion, a power assignment algorithm, Algorithm 4, is proposed. Moreover, the authors have also provided the convergence analysis stating that the solution converges to local optimal solution satisfying Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions of the original problem (5.18).

5.3.4 Joint User Clustering and Resource Allocation in NOMA: JUCRAN
This section presents the joint user clustering and resource allocation in NOMA (JUCRAN) algorithm, as illustrated in Algorithm 5. In the initialization phase, the information of classiﬁer users and CSI information of all users is collected by MBS. Then the required number of NOMA clusters is computed using Algorithm 1. This step also includes the initialization of equal number of resource blocks for every NOMA cluster and equal power transmission for all users. In the joint phase 2, all of the three algorithms such as power assignment, RB allocation, and user clustering are iteratively performed till the solution (5.5). Finally, the convergence to a suboptimal solution of the JUCRAN algorithm for the problem in (5.5) is proved by the authors.

5.4 Simulation Results

5.4.1 Simulation Setting

This section presents the performance evaluation of the joint algorithm JUCRAN for downlink NOMA WNV. For simulation, one BS positioned at the center of the cell. A uniform distribution of the users is considered in a circular cell of range 500 m. The number of resource blocks, each resource block bandwidth, system bandwidth, and maximum transmission power of MBS are considered as Ω = 100, B = 180 KHz, 20 MHz, and 40 W, respectively. The maximum transmission power is varied in some simulations for investigation of the trade-off between energy efﬁciency and throughput. In the simulation, three MVNOs are considered with each having uniformly distributed users along with similar QoS constraints. For all resource blocks, the power of noise is taken equal to 10−13 W. The small-scale fading channel coefﬁcients are generated as i.i.d. Rayleigh random variables having unit variance.
Performance comparison of the proposed scheme with OFDMA has been performed. Moreover, the comparison of the proposed scheme JUCRAN for three different users cases (such as weak users, normal users, and strong users) denoted by JUCRAN-3 and given in Algorithm 1 is also performed with a scheme JUCRAN-2 that uses two users classes. The usage of two users cases is similar to a proposal in [1]. All the results are obtained by taking an average of the 100 simulations that are performed for random topologies.

5.4.2 Numerical Results
The number of iterations needed by the JUCRAN-3 and JUCRAN-2 schemes versus network users number is shown in Fig. 5.3. It is clear from Fig. 5.3 that the number of iterations for JUCRAN-2 is higher than JUCRAN-3. Further, the number of iterations has an increased trend for the rise in network users. In JUCRAN-3, the iterations needed for convergence are less due to the fact that quota of each cluster is taken 3 which tended to accept more users. Furthermore, the number of clusters that are created in JUCRAN-2 is more than for JUCRAN-3 scheme which causes the accept-reject process to use more iterations because of the high number of clusters. The average number of cluster formations versus network users is plotted in Fig. 5.4, which reveals that the number of clusters for JUCRAN-2 is always higher than JUCRAN-3. This trend is due to the fact that a number of users per class in JUCRAN-3 are lower than JUCRAN-2.
The convergence of the proposed joint scheme is shown in Fig. 5.5. The performance is evaluated for three different instances such as 50, 30, and 10 users. It is clear from Fig. 5.5 that the proposed JUCRAN converges quickly for limited iterations. Moreover, the relative utility of JUCRAN-3 is higher than JUCRAN-2.

This is due to the fact that JUCRAN-3 has the ability to accommodate more users than JUCRAN-2, which enable JUCRAN-3 to fulﬁll the minimum rate for more users. In Fig. 5.6, the network throughput is plotted versus the network’s users. The total throughput is evaluated through the average total sum-rate over the different number of users. The throughput of both JUCRAN-3 and JUCRAN-3 increases with an increase in the number of users until the number of users gets saturated. For the number of users more than 50, it is observed that the total throughput shows a trend of continuous increase because of the multi-diversity gain. However, this

The performance of JUCRAN-2 and JUCRAN-3 is almost comparable, but better than OFDMA signiﬁcantly. From Fig. 5.6, it is clear that InP cannot obtain a signiﬁcant advantage of resource allocation for the case OFDMA.

5.5 Summary

In this chapter, we discuss about the beneﬁts achieved by using the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme over the traditional orthogonal multiple access scheme in a wireless virtualization setting. User clustering and resource allocation are considered the vital challenges in NOMA that requires to be addressed by efﬁcient schemes. Furthermore, we surveyed a work that jointly addresses the problem of user clustering, resource, and power allocation in wireless virtualization setting to enhance the overall network performance.

Chapter 6
Network Slicing: Cache and Backhaul Resource Allocation

6.1 Introduction
Traditionally in cellular networks radio resources were only considered as a performance bottleneck. Therefore, a number of solutions were devised to only cater the radio resource allocation challenge. A similar trend has been followed for deriving solutions for network slicing as well in which only radio resources were sliced to fulﬁll the end user requirements which has been discussed in the previous chapters. However, the proliferation of end users and novel applications have also imposed limitations on other network resources such as backhaul and cache spaces. In this chapter, we would discuss two novel solutions which consider these resources along with the radio resources to build networking slices.
6.2 Network Slicing with Backhaul Constraints
In the ﬁrst work [6], the backhaul resources are considered for slicing the network. This work mainly dealt with the network virtualization targeting the uplink of a cellular network. They developed a novel technique enchaining the spectrum and infrastructure efﬁciency. They designed the system capable of maximizing the MVNO proﬁt along with guaranteeing the users QoS requirements and InP’s backhaul constraints. They used slice isolation-based approach for uplink of a cellular network, for ﬁnding the sub-optimal decision on slice and transmit power allocation. Then, they designed a distributed algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation, and for the convergence of sub-optimal point they utilized matching game technique.

6 Network Slicing: Cache and Backhaul Resource Allocation

6.2.1 System Model

Consider the uplink transmission of the OFDMA-based virtualized cellular network as illustrated in Fig. 6.1. The set B = {1, 2, . . . , B} of infrastructure providers
(InPs) provides the network resources to mobile virtual network operators (MVNO)
on rent. The system model consists of a small area covered by overlapping small cells of multiple InPs. The set I = {1, 2, . . . , I } of service providers (SP) are provided with the virtual resources by the MVNO. Every service provider i ∈ I has its own subscribers set U i = {1, 2, . . . , Ui}. The users set of all service providers is represented by U . The infrastructure provider b has subcarriers set Lb = {1, 2, . . . , Lb}, that is further transformed into Cb = {1, 2, . . . , Cb} chunks. Every chunk is formed by aggregating Lb,c = {1, 2, . . . , Lb/Cb} subcarriers. The bandwidth of narrowband orthogonal subcarriers is W . Apart from that, no
interference is assumed between the small cells of different and same infrastructure
providers. The set that consists of S slices is used for isolation of the infrastructure services.
A pair of chunk and base station is utilized for unique determination of a slice. The slice allocation matrix is denoted by α = [αbu,c]|U|×(|Cb|×B). The binary variable

Consider the user u that is subscribed to the service provider i, then the constraint

for guaranteeing the required minimum rate Rui ,min is given by:

Rui (α, P ) ≥ Rui ,min, ∀u ∈ U , ∀i ∈ I.

(6.2)

The aggregated data rate of users must satisfy the constraint given below to avoid congestion at the backhaul links of infrastructure provider small-cell base station:

Rui (α, P ) ≤ Zb,bh, ∀b ∈ B, ∀c ∈ Cb,
i∈I u∈Ui :αbu,c=1

(6.3)

where the small-cell base station b backhaul capacity is Zb,bh ≥ 0. The MVNO network utility attained by allocation of the transmit power and slice allocation to service providers users is given by:

UMVNO(α, P ) = U rev(α, P ) − U cost(α, P ),
