IPv6 – Overview
- Provides many more addresses, to satisfy current and future needs, with ample space for innovation. 2128 addresses
- 40-byte IP header - Ability to do end-to-end IPsec (IP security) - Unicast (one to one), Multicast (one to many), Anycast (one
to nearest) and Reserved (special uses of some addresses)

IPv6 – Overview
Example 1: 3FFE:085B:1F1F:0000:0000:0000:00A9:1234
Leading zeros can be removed
3FFE:85B:1F1F::A9:1234 :: = all zeros in one or more group of 16-bit hexadecimal numbers

2001:db8:A:0:0:12:0:80
a) 2001:db8:A::12:0:80 b) 2001:db8:A::12::80 c) 2001:db8:A:0:0:12::80

IPv6 – Overview
Network prefix 1) Example of compressed form : 2001:0db8:0001:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 is 2001:db8:1::/48
The first 48 bits will always be the same 2001:0db8:0001
2) /64 prefix is always used in a LAN (Local Area Network) - Rightmost 64 bits are called the interface identifier or host’s
interface - Left part defines the network identifier

IPv6 – Overview
Unspecified address → 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0 (::/128) Loopback address → 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 (::1/128) Documentation Prefix → 2001:db8::/32 (used in examples and documentation)
Link-local: addresses with prefix FE80::/10. They are used to communicate with other hosts on the same local network.
ULA (Unique Local Address) start with the prefix FC00::/7, which is in practice means that you can see FC00::/8 or FD00::/8
Global Unicast: Equivalent to the IPv4 public addresses,

IPv6 – Overview
IPv6 can be configured :
- Statically like IPv4 - DHCPv6 (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol IPv6) like
DHCPv4 - SLAAC (StateLess Address AutoConfiguration) : New
mechanism to configure automatically all network parameters - « Plug and net »

IPv6 – Overview
SLAAC mechanism
Link-local: fe80::3432:7ff1:c001:c2a1
Link-local: fe80::a:b:c

Periodically, the router sends a global prefix

RS
RA: Prefix = 2001:db8:1:2::/64
Gateway: fe80::a:b:c IP: 2001:db8:1:2:3432:7ff1:c001:c2a1

IPv6 – Overview
Three cases with IPv6 addressing
Case 1: Native IPv6 connectivity: both router and ISP support IPv6 addressing→IPv4 and IPv6 are supported dual stack
Case 2: No IPv6 connectivity: ISP doesn’t support IPv6 but IPv6 is supported by router → IPv6 transition mechanism → 6in4 tunnel
Case 3: No IPv6 connectivity and No IPv4 capable router: → Add a new router that support IPv6 and IPv4 and create 6in4 tunnel

6LowPAN
6LowPAN: IPv6 over low Power Wireless Personal Area Networks - It defines IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4 standard
REST

Rafik Zitouni

12

6LowPAN
Main proprieties of 6LowPan - The maximum size available for transmitting IP packets over an IEEE
802.15.4 frame is 81 bytes (payload) - The minimum MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) that link layer should
offer to IPv6 layer is 1280 bytes - Mesh Routing Protocol [RFC 6550]: RPL (Routing protocol for Low
Power and Lossy Networks) - IEEE 802.15.4 defines four types of frames:
- Beacon frames - MAC command frames - Acknowledgement frames - Data frames

6LowPan headers

6LowPAN – Link-local address
IPv6 Interface Identifier (IID) from EUI-48 or MAC address

7th bit from the left is flipped

The generated IPv6 address is : FE80::0221:2FFF:FEB5:6E10

CoAP Constrained Application Protocol
Why the web has the actual success ?
➢ Uniform representation of documents → HTML
➢ Uniform Referents for Data and Services on the Web → URI
➢ Universal Transfert Protocol → HTTP
➢ Representational State Transfert Architecture → REST
Is it possible to establish web communication with constrained 8/16-bit Microcontrollers ? ▪ TCP as the Transport Protocol, too heavy for LLN motes; ▪ SSL/TLS for security: too heavy;

CoAP Constrained Application Protocol
Characteristics (RFC 7252 https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-coap-18 )
➢ Constrained machine-to-machine web protocol ➢ Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture ➢ UDP binding (may use IPsec or DTLS) ➢ Asynchronous message exchanges ➢ Simple proxying and caching capabilities

CoAP Constrained Application Protocol
Client/server Architecture
CoAP implementation acts both in client and server role
➢ Response codes - 2.xx success code - 2.01 HTTP 201 “created” - 2.02 Deleted or HTTP 204 “No content” You can find others in the RFC definition
➢ Method codes - GET, POST, PUT and DELET
➢ Asynchronous Exchange

CoAP Constrained Application Protocol
The CoAP two layer approach
Messages Layer: It deals with UDP and the asynchronous nature of the interactions Request Response Layer: Method and Response codes
CoAP is a single protocol, with messages and request/response just features of the CoAP header

CoAP Constrained Application Protocol
CoAP header (4 bytes)

Ver (Version):1; T (Type): Confirmable, Non-Confirmable, ACK, Reset; TKL (Token-Length): Length of the token field; Code: Request Method (1-10) or response code (40-255) Message ID: 16 bits duplicate detection (NON), matching ack/reset to Requests (CON); Token: used to correlate requests and responses;

CoAP Constrained Application Protocol
Caching and proxiying
CoAP supports caching of responses to efficiently fulfill requests. Simple Caches is particularly useful in constrained networks for several reasons: - Including traffic limiting - Performance improving, - Resources accessing times - Security.
