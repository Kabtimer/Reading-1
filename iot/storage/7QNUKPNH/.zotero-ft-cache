Contents
q We will show how to install/configure/use the WAZIUP LoRa IoT kit. The kit consits of
q A pre-configured LoRa gateway
q The gateway will send data to the WAZIUP platform q The gateway will also send data to a ThingSpeak demo
channel
q A pre-configured end-device
q Equipped with a temperature sensor q When powered on, sends every 10 minutes a measure
to the gateway q Has built-in low-power management: can run about 1
year with 4 AA batteries

What you should get
Place the RPI3 in the case and insert the SD card

connecting & powering the gateway
q Connect the gateway with an Ethernet cable to your LAN that provides DHCP
q Alternatively
q Configure a laptop to share a WiFi Internet connection on its Ethernet port
q Connect the gateway to your laptop with an Ethernet cable
q Power the gateway with a USB cable connected to a 5V adaptor or a USB entry (e.g. laptop)
q Wait about 1 minute for the gateway to boot q The gateway should get an IP address from your
LAN/laptop DHCP server q Normally the gateway has now Internet access q Use dedicated tool to discover the gateway IP
address
q Angry IP scanner (MacOSX)
6

Connect to the gateway through WiFi
q The gateway is also configured as a WiFi access point with address 192.168.200.1
q Select the WAZIUP_PI_GW_xxxxxxxxxx WiFi q WiFi password is loragateway

q http://192.168.200.1/admin

q Login: admin

q Password: loragateway

Updating the gateway

q Gateway update section

Update the web admin interface. Use this feature after an update of the distribution to install the last version of the web admin interface. It is recommended to run "Update web admin" after a "Full update". Then reload the page.

Update with latest version on github, all your configuration files will be kept. This is the recommended option.

Will compile and configure the gateway,

especially for the gateway id & the WiFi SSID

derived from the last 5 bytes of the eth MAC

address. This is also required if you install a

new gateway using the provided SD card

image. It is recommended to run "Basic config"

right after "Full update".

Configure WAZIUP cloud
q Configuring WAZIUP Orion cloud

Project name will be the FIWARE Orion Service
Organization name will be used to derive the sensor name which will be for instance ORG_Sensor2

Enter your organization name (default is ORG) and the service-path (default is /MVP/TEST)
Must begin with a '/'. The FIWARE Orion Servicepath will be derived using both the Organization name and the Service tree: '/'+organization_name+service_tree, giving '/'+'ORG'+'/MVP/TEST' ➔ '/ORG/MVP/TEST'

The IoT demo end-device
Arduino Pro Mini with LoRa radio module & temperature sensor
10

The IoT end-device hardware platform
Arduino Pro Mini in the 3.3v and 8MHz version: ~2€
11

Switch on the end-device
q Put 4 AA batteries in battery pack if needed q Connect the 2 floating VCC wire (red), don’t
touch the end side connected to the board q Check that power led of the board is on
12

End-device behavior
q Once switched on the end-device will
1. Initialize the radio 2. Take a measure (temperature) Takes about 4s 3. Send the measure to gateway 4. Go to sleep for 10 minutes and repeat from step 2
q After demonstration, just disconnect the VCC wires (red)
q No need to remove the batteries
13

Default configuration
\!#4#TC/24.81
24.81 is an example, real temperature will be read by temperature sensor
The default configuration in the Arduino_LoRa_Simple_temp example is: Send packets to the gateway Use LoRa mode 1 Node short address is 8
14

Gateway to cloud
Data received at the gateway will be pushed to the WAZIUP demo ThingSpeak channel
https://thingspeak.com/channels/123986 15

Advanced configuration
q Use ssh to connect to the gateway q Change the gateway WiFi password q Change the web admin interface password
16

SSH to the gateway with WiFi
q The gateway is also configured as a WiFi access point with address 192.168.200.1
q Select the WAZIUP_PI_GW_xxxxxxxxxx WiFi q WiFi password is loragateway q Then ssh pi@192.168.200.1 q Login password is loragateway
17

Gateway system configuration (1)
q Gateway WiFi access point
Set the gateway's access point SSID (should normally be preconfigured, see Update section) Also allow to define/change the access point WiFi password
18

Gateway system configuration (2)
q Gateway web admin interface
Change both the login and password to access the web admin interface. Default login is admin and default password is loragateway
