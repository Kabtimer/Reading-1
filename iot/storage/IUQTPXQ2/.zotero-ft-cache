Abstract In ﬁfth generation heterogeneous network, small cell is developed to compensate the growing demand for mobile data services. Due to the smaller size of cell, users have a short duration of connection, however, the user may also have the need of handoff frequently. At the time of handoff, different networks are available with different data rate and different other parameters. So, there is the need of frequent selection for the optimal network. In this paper, a utility-aware optimization algorithm has been proposed for network selection in a heterogeneous environment of Wi-Fi, WiMAX, WLAN, LTE, UMTS, and GPRS network. The weight factor is proposed for modiﬁed Jaya algorithm which is calculated by the analytical hierarchical process, standard deviation, and entropy method. Different applications are considered such as video, voice, web browsing and email transfer in which available bandwidth, packet jitter, packet loss, cost per byte are taken as dominant attributes, respectively. According to the dominant factor, different networks are selected for different applications because the requirement of all applications cannot be fulﬁlled by one network. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with multi-attribute decision making algorithms and game theory and accuracy of the proposed algorithm is calculated. The accuracy of proposed algorithm is higher as compared to the other algorithms and at the same time, this algorithm requires less computation which can further reduce the handoff latency and failure probability. Hence, the performance of handoff can be improved by using modiﬁed Jaya algorithm.

1 Introduction
The demand of mobile data is increasing during the last few years due to increasing numbers of applications. The user would like to be connected at anywhere and anytime regardless of their location [1]. The rapid demand of mobile data cannot be fulﬁlled by the fourth generation (4G) network so it moves the research towards the ﬁfth generation (5G) [2]. The 5G network provides the better quality at every location and at every time [3]. It takes the advantage of different advance technologies i.e. millimeter wave (mm-Wave) communication, massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO), cognitive radio communication,

ultra-dense network, small cell technology, heterogeneous network etc. as well as different other provisioning technologies [4]. For efﬁcient communication, two of the different technologies of 5G network may be combined. So, to increase both energy efﬁciency and spectral efﬁciency, the ultra-dense network is combined with mm-Wave technology [5] by considering the different factors such as load balancing, energy harvesting and cross-tier interference. A gradient association technique is proposed to solve this optimization problem which further improves the network utility and energy efﬁciency.
For increasing the coverage and system capacity, small cell i.e. femtocell, picocell and microcell is used with macrocell. The small cell relieves the burden of macrocell by providing the hotspot to the indoor and outdoor users. A lot of research has been done on the small cell because it helps in spectrum reuse with less power consumption and increases the coverage area with low infrastructure cost [6]. Despite their advantages, there are some problems arise in small cell network such as interference management,

resource allocation, mobility management due to heterogeneous network [7]. The efﬁcient energy resource allocation in heterogeneous small cell network is discussed in [8] with Wi-Fi spectrum sharing. Another, in orthogonal frequency division multiple access [9], the power allocation, backhaul bandwidth allocation, and efﬁcient energy consumption are considered. It allocates the transmit power of small cell in such a manner so that it increases the energy efﬁciency.
Due to the smaller size of cell in a 5G network, there is always a need for mobility management especially vertical handoff [10]. The process of vertical handoff from one network to another network happens when the selected network does not provide the required service for the speciﬁc application [11]. The selection decision is made at the time of call initialization and then subsequently every time during the call as a part of handoff execution. The selection decision should be right for providing the uninterrupted service to users. Therefore, the network selection becomes necessary for every mobile user [12].
The selection of network is the complicated problem which can be solved by different methods. In cognitive radio, there is always a need of network selection for secondary user. Three different network selection strategies namely random, weighted and greedy are considered in collision constrained network selection [13]. The collision constrained method achieves an improved performance in terms of system throughput and collision probability. The probabilistic approach [14] decides the initial and target channel in cognitive radio for handoff procedure. The performance of this approach is determined in terms of average sojourn and extended service times.
The selection of network using probabilistic approach [15] considered the transition and steady state network selection probability in Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). Based on the steady-state probabilities, two network parameters such as call blocking probabilities and network throughput are evaluated. As the number of users increases, these two parameters start decreasing. So, this method does not give an optimal result for a larger number of users. A network-assisted approach [16] for selection of network in heterogeneous cellular networks jointly enhance network performance and user experience. In this approach, a semiMarkov decision process is used and it is solved by policy iteration algorithm. It has the advantage of requiring no prior parameterization but needs to pertinently set the tuning thresholds for the optimal solution. To predict the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) at every location, adaptive handoff trigger strategy [17] is used. The problem is formulated in terms of hidden markov models (HMM) which further improve the handoff probability and handoff success probability.

Multi-attribute decision making (MADM) algorithms are most commonly used method for network selection [18]. Different MADM algorithms include Simple Additive Weighting (SAW), Multiplicative Exponential Weighting (MEW), Grey Relational Analysis (GRA), Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and VIKOR (VlseKriterijumska Optimizacijia I Kompromisno Resenje, in Serbian) are used for ranking of networks. In the literature [19], MADM algorithm is weighted by analytical hierarchical process (AHP) method. In the AHP method, the relative importance of different indexes should be accurate. If the number of the attribute is increased, then the complete comparison matrix is reconstructed. In the MADM algorithm, the selection is done on the basis of user’s preferences [20] and the user always tries to maximize their utility so their decision may lead to an inefﬁcient performance in terms of network utilization.
Game theory, a decision-making technique in case of a complex problem, is also used for selection of a network. It is a most useful tool for analyzing and modeling the problem of the 5G heterogeneous network as discussed in [21]. The author in [22] described the basic concept of game theory in network selection and different types of games. The main elements of a game are players, the strategy of each player and the payoff function associated with each strategy of each player in a game. A tutorial survey on game theoretic approach [23] in cognitive radio networks is given and it is used for dynamic spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks. In reputation based network selection [24], the user–network interaction is modeled as a cooperative game. The network reputation factor is considered which reﬂects the network’s previous behavior in assuring service guarantees to the user.
The author in [25] used the dynamic evolutionary game for sharing of bandwidth in heterogeneous wireless networks. Evolutionary game model, a non-cooperative, user versus user game, is used for network selection where players are the user involved in the selection and their strategy is to select the network. The selection is done from three different networks and payoff function is used as a selection criterion. Network selection using bankruptcy game theory is described in [26]. Bankruptcy game model, a cooperative, network versus network game model is used, where players are the available network and the strategy is the coalition formation of the available network to provide resources to the user and payoff is calculated by using the characteristic function for each formed coalition [27]. Cloud-based network selection using coalition formation game [28] is used to balance system throughput and fairness with built-in utility division rule of the framework. The algorithm efﬁciency showed eight-time enhancement over a conventional coalition formation algorithm. The

123

main problem encountered with game theory is its complexity for a large number of users [29].
The authors in [30] propose an energy-aware utility function for user-centric network selection strategy and multimedia delivery in a heterogeneous wireless network. Based on the mobile device type, network conditions, application requirements and user preferences, the energyaware utility function selects the best value network which satisﬁes the user needs. Multi-criteria optimization [31] has the advantage of network selection in an efﬁcient way for both perspectives, i.e. the end user and the network operators. A multi-criteria utility function is proposed that satisﬁes all the properties to maximize the Quality of Experience (QoE) of the end user and acceptance probability for the network operator’s radio resource management [32]. An important highlighted result is that this network selection not only beneﬁts the end users but it also increases the revenues of network operators as well.
During the last few years, the optimization ﬁeld has been grown rapidly [33]. Many optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithm (GA) [34], particle swarm optimization (PSO) [35, 36], artiﬁcial bee colony (ABC) [37] are used for solving the problem of network selection. GA is adaptive heuristic optimization algorithm which is based on the evolutionary natural selection. As compared to GA, PSO algorithm is easier to implement and achieve fast convergence. The main difﬁculty in PSO algorithm is its tuning of different parameters. In ABC algorithm, there is the need of objective function evaluations and it became slow for serial processing. To overcome the drawback of these algorithms, the teaching–learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm [38] is proposed. It is based on the fact that the teaching affects the learner output. In TLBO algorithm, there is the need of two-phase i.e. teaching and learning phase. The main drawback of TLBO algorithm is its convergence rate for higher dimension problems. To overcome the drawback of TLBO algorithm, Jaya algorithm is proposed [39]. The Jaya algorithm is the parameter-free algorithm and requires only control parameters. But Jaya algorithm cannot be used for a speciﬁc application because there is no concept of weight. So, there is the need for modiﬁcation in Jaya algorithm. The main contributions of this paper are:
• The Jaya algorithm is modiﬁed and weight concept is proposed for the Jaya algorithm. Due to the addition of weight factor in Jaya algorithm, it can be used for any speciﬁc applications which can further increase the Quality of experience (QoE) of the user.
• The complex problem is converted into a simple optimization algorithm using the energy utility function. In literature [40, 41], the utility function is associated with the different game theory. The game

theory suffers the problem of complexity. So, the problem of complexity is removed in this paper. • The justiﬁcation towards the results of Jaya algorithm is done by comparing the results to the game theory and MADM algorithm. The results show the modiﬁed Jaya algorithm gives the correct results with less complexity. • Finally, the performance of Jaya algorithm is shown in terms of accuracy. The Jaya algorithm performs the network selection in an accurate manner with less computation which can further reduce the handoff latency and handoff failure probability.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 introduces the weight calculation methods. Section 3 discusses the modiﬁed Jaya algorithm. In Sect. 4, simulation results using different weight calculation and score calculation methods are discussed. Finally, in Sect. 5, the conclusion is given.
2 Weight calculation methods
2.1 Analytical hierarchical process (AHP)
AHP method is used to assign the weights to each attribute in the network selection strategy. It is the most commonly used method that is developed by Saaty [42]. It consists of different steps for weight calculation:
Step 1: Construct a hierarchy structure: First of all, the objective of the problem is deﬁned in terms of different factors. Then the network selection problem is broken down into a hierarchical structure as shown in Fig. 1 where at the middle level, attributes are placed and at a lower level, networks are placed. Step 2: Construct comparison matrix: The pair wise comparison matrix is given by X = [xij]m9m where m denotes the total number of attributes and xii ¼ 1; xij ¼ 1=xji; xij 6¼ 0. The element xij is deﬁned by Saaty’s scale from 1 to 9 values as shown in Table 1. The scale number is given according to their importance of one attribute to another.

equal to 10%, the inconsistency is acceptable otherwise we need to revise the matrix.

2.2 Standard deviation (SD) method

The standard deviation method is used for weight calculation based on the principle of the degree of variation. Normally, the standard deviation is directly proportional to the variation of attributes range of a certain index. So, if the degree of variation in attributes range is large, then the standard deviation is also large. It means it offers more amount of information. The more information plays an important role in the evaluation work, so the weight becomes larger. Conversely, lower degree of variation contains small weight [43]. It consists of different steps:

Step 1: Construct decision matrix: The decision matrix is

constructed by taking the ith network and jth attributes.

The decision matrix is presented by A = [aij]m9n where m denotes the number of networks and n denotes the

number of attributes.

Step 2: Normalization: There are two types of normal-

ization: beneﬁt type and cost type. For beneﬁt type, the

normalization is done by

where amj ax = max(a1j, a2j, ….amj) and amj in = min(a1j, a2j, … ,amj). Step 3: Calculate standard deviation: The standard deviation for m network is calculated by Shuo and Qi

2.3 Entropy method

3 Modified Jaya algorithm

The entropy method is also used for weight calculation which is proposed by Shannon. In the communication system, the information entropy is related to the uncertainty of signals. Entropy method is also based on the variation degree of a certain index. If the information entropy is less, then the variation degree is more. It plays an important role because it contains more information so the larger weight should be assigned to that. Conversely, a large value of entropy indicates small variation and contains less information so it should be assigned smaller weight [44]. The different steps for weight calculation are:

Step 1: Construct decision matrix: The decision matrix is constructed by taking the ith network and jth attributes. The decision matrix is presented by A = [aij]m9n where m denotes the number of networks and n denotes the number of attributes. Step 2: Normalization: There are two types of normalization: beneﬁt type and cost type. For beneﬁt type, the normalization is done by

ð11Þ

For cost type, the normalization is done by

Step 3: Calculate Entropy: The information entropy for

each attribute is calculated by:

ð13Þ

where

pij

when pij ¼ 0 ,so pij ln pij ¼ 0 Step 4: Calculate weight: The weight for different attributes is calculated by Delgado and Romero [44]:

wej n ¼ n À1PÀ njE¼1j Ej forj ¼ 1; 2; . . .; n Xn
0 wej n 1; wej n ¼ 1
j¼1

ð15Þ

If the difference between attributes range is small, then the value of entropy is large and it contains small information. Therefore, the smaller weight is assigned to that attribute.

Jaya algorithm is an optimization algorithm which is

applied to constraint and unconstrained optimization

problem. This algorithm is the reduced form of Teaching–

Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm because

in Jaya algorithm, fewer parameters are required and only

one teacher phase is required whereas TLBO algorithm

required two-phase i.e. teaching and learning phase [45].

The Jaya algorithm is based on the concept that the results

are going in the direction of best solution and in the

opposite direction of the worst solution [46]. In this paper,

the Jaya algorithm is modiﬁed in terms of network selec-

tion which is deﬁned in algorithm 1.

The decision matrix is constructed by taking the ith

network and jth attributes. The attributes should be in the

same scale so that the normalization becomes necessary.

There are two types of normalizations i.e. beneﬁt normal-

ization and cost normalization. The beneﬁt normalization is

done for larger the better attributes e.g. bandwidth, security

etc. while the cost normalization is done for the smaller the

better attributes e.g. cost, delay [47]. The utility function is

based on the principle of the larger the better criteria [48].

The one utility function is used for all parameters because

here beneﬁt and cost normalization is done for different

beneﬁt and cost parameters, so there is no need of cost

function. The energy utility function is used where utility

indicates the usefulness of network parameters. Here, the

utility function relates to the service derived by the user

from the networks. Every user has different preference so

according to their preference, they have different utility

function for the same network. The utility function u(x) is

deﬁned as:

xa xa

x\xa xa\x\xb

ð16Þ

otherwise

where x is the deﬁned attribute for the network, xa is the minimum value of the attribute and xb is the maximum value of the attribute.
After the calculation of utility function, the weight factor is considered. The weight is calculated by different weight calculation methods as discussed in the last section. Then identify the best and the worst network based on the concept of the utility function. The maximum utility function is identiﬁed as the best solution and minimum utility function is identiﬁed as the worst solution.

The solution is modiﬁed based on the concept that the search is going in the direction of the best solution and

The complete procedure of modiﬁed Jaya algorithm is shown in Fig. 2. This proposed algorithm is different from the Jaya algorithm [46] because in this algorithm the weight factor is considered and selection is done on the basis of utility function.

4 Results and discussion
The simulation scenario consists of heterogeneous network i.e. Wi-Fi, WiMAX, WLAN, LTE, UMTS, and GPRS. WiMAX and LTE are the 4G network, UMTS is the 3G, GPRS is the 2.5G and Wi-Fi and WLAN can be the 3G or 4G network. WiMAX, LTE, UMTS, GPRS is the wide area network while Wi-Fi and WLAN is the local area network. The different attributes are considered i.e. Available Bandwidth (AB) in Mbps, Propagation Delay (PD) in millisecond, Packet Jitter (PJ) in millisecond, Cost per Byte (CB) in percent, Packet Loss (PL) per every 106 packets and network deployment (ND) factor. The framework of network selection in heterogeneous networks scenario is shown in Fig. 3. This scenario is designed for four different applications i.e. video, voice, web browsing and email transfer. The different networks are selected for different applications according to the user preference. Each network has different attributes range which is given in Table 3. The simulation is performed on MATLAB software. The weight is calculated by subjective and objective methods. AHP method is termed as subjective method because in this method user preference is considered. Standard deviation and entropy methods are termed as objective method because, in these methods, user preference is not considered. In the network selection results, the

attributes are combined to their weights by different network selection methods i.e. modiﬁed Jaya algorithm, game theory [49] and MADM algorithm [50].
4.1 Weight calculation results
The four applications i.e. video, voice, web and email transfer are examined and every application is corresponding to the six different attributes. The weight calculated by the AHP, standard deviation and entropy method is shown in Fig. 4.
For the video application, the highest weight is given to the AB attribute because video application has the requirement for maximum bandwidth. So, for this application, the ﬁrst precedence is given to AB and second precedence is given to ND attribute. For voice application, the ﬂow of information should be continuous, so PJ and PD should be minimal. So, for this application, the ﬁrst precedence is given to PJ and second precedence is given to PD. For third and fourth application, i.e. web browsing and email transfer, importance is given to PL and CB attribute respectively. For all these applications, AHP

method is used for assigning the weights. In the AHP method, the user can give the weight according to their requirement and applications which increase the Quality of Experience (QoE) of the user. In another two methods of weight i.e. standard deviation and entropy method, the assigned weights depend upon the attributes range. In the standard deviation method, the weight assigned to the attribute is directly proportional to the variation of its range. If the variation degree is small, then the standard deviation is also small and less weight is assigned to that attribute and vice versa. So, AB attribute is assigned maximum weight and PJ attribute is assigned minimum weight and so on. In the entropy weight calculation method, the weight is directly proportional to the information. If the difference between the attribute range is large, then it contains more information and larger weight is assigned to that attribute. So, in the entropy method, the AB attribute is assigned maximum weight. In the standard deviation and entropy weight calculation method, no user precedence is considered and weight depends upon the attribute range. So, this method cannot be used for any speciﬁc application. In the AHP method, the user can give importance according to their requirement as in this paper, it is used for different applications.
4.2 Network selection results
In this paper, the performance of modiﬁed Jaya algorithm is shown in terms of AHP, entropy and standard deviation weights.
The scores of different networks obtained by modiﬁed Jaya algorithm using utility function is shown in Fig. 5. For video application, the most precedence is given to AB, the second precedence is given to ND, the third precedence is given to PD and forth precedence is given to PJ attribute as shown in Fig. 4. The WiMAX and LTE network has the same range of AB, PD and PJ attribute but the different value of ND attribute. So, in that case, the second attribute is considered because it has different attribute value. As the WiMAX network is not widely deployed while LTE network is most common in use. So, due to consideration of all weight, LTE network is selected. As WiMAX network also provides maximum bandwidth but deployment factor of LTE network is large as compared to WiMAX network. So, WiMAX network is not selected for video application. In the case of the voice application, WiMAX network is selected although WiMAX, LTE, UMTS, and GPRS all these networks have minimum PJ. In this case, second and third precedence is considered. The second precedence is given to PD and the third precedence is given to PL. Although UMTS network has minimum PD but it has maximum PL so it is not selected for the voice application. Then after UMTS, the LTE and WiMAX network has

minimum PD but LTE network has larger range of PL and WiMAX network has lower range of PL, so WiMAX network is selected for the voice application. WLAN network is selected for web application because for this application ﬁrst precedence is given to PL attribute and the second precedence is given to PD attribute. Although WiMAX network has minimum range of PL but WiMAX network is not widely deployed so WLAN network is selected for web application due to lower PL and higher PD. Also, the WLAN network is selected for email application because for this application, the ﬁrst precedence is given to CB and second precedence is given to PL attribute. In the standard deviation and entropy weight calculation result, the ﬁrst precedence is given to AB and second precedence is given to CB. So, by taking consideration of AB and CB, WiMAX network is selected for both applications. Jaya algorithm is easy to implement and it can

accommodate multiple criteria for selection with less complexity.
The network scores obtained by game theory, TOPSIS, GRA are shown in Figs. 6, 7 and 8 respectively. The game theory [49], TOPSIS [51, 52] and GRA [53] algorithm is applied to the network attribute Table 3 and same weight calculation results are considered which is applied in the modiﬁed Jaya algorithm. The concept of TOPSIS method is simple and comprehensive. It gives the selection result with high efﬁciency and ﬂexibility. GRA method can handle many parameters and give a precise solution. But it is very complicated because as the number of level increases, length of the process also increases. In this game theory, the network provides resources to the mobile user. As mutual cooperation occurred among different networks, so it provides more resources to the users. In the game theory, all preference is considered and after that network selection is done. For video application, ﬁrst preference is

given to AB, second preference is given to ND, third preference is given to PD and forth preference is given to PJ parameter. By considering all these parameters, LTE network is selected. Although WiMAX and LTE network both have equal AB, PD, and PJ but ND attribute of LTE network is more as compared to WiMAX. Similarly, by considering all weights factors, for voice application, WiMAX network is selected. Similarly, for web and email application, WLAN network is selected by considering all

weight factors. For standard deviation and entropy weight, WiMAX network is selected due to the same reason.
The comparison of ranking scores of Jaya algorithm to another method of network selection i.e. game theory, TOPSIS, GRA is given in Table 4.
4.3 Accuracy
The accuracy of the ranking scores is calculated by subtracting of the minimum ranking score from the maximum

123

Fig. 6 Network score using game theory

Fig. 7 Network score using TOPSIS method

ranking score. In the ranking range, the difference between the minimum and maximum is determined. If the difference between the ranking scores is small, then identiﬁcation of best alternative becomes difﬁcult. Sometimes, this type of situation may lead to confusion in recognizing the best alternative. So, to avoid such situation, the difference between the maximum and minimum ranking values should be large. The modiﬁed Jaya algorithm is compared with another method in terms of accuracy by applying the different weight calculation methods.
The accuracy of different ranking scores obtained by different methods is shown in the Table 5. The result

shows that the modiﬁed Jaya algorithm has maximum difference in ranking values so it is the most accurate selection technique. The modiﬁed Jaya algorithm is 35 and 50% more accurate as compared to the GRA and TOPSIS method and 67% more accurate as compared to the game theory. The accuracy of game theory is least because of its cooperative nature. As all the networks cooperatively provide resources to the users so the performance of all the networks are almost equal. Due to the least difference in ranking scores, the accuracy of game theory is less. So, in terms of accuracy, modiﬁed Jaya algorithm is best from all other methods.

5 Conclusion
The selection of an optimal network plays an important role in the ongoing session of call at the time of handoff. The decision of network selection is inﬂuenced by the different factors. In this paper, a utility-based optimization algorithm is proposed for the network selection. The Jaya algorithm has been modiﬁed by including weight factor as user preference plays an important role in the selection criteria for increasing QoE of the user. The weight is calculated by AHP, standard deviation, and entropy method. The heterogeneous environment of Wi-Fi, WiMAX, WLAN, LTE, UMTS, and GPRS network is considered in which different networks are selected for different applications because for every application there are different requirements. For video application, LTE network has been selected due to higher deployment factor and for voice application, WiMAX network is selected as it has the less jitter and highest bandwidth and for web and email application, WLAN network is selected due to lower loss and cost. The selection results are compared with the MADM algorithm and game theory and ﬁnally accuracy of the modiﬁed Jaya algorithm is calculated. The modiﬁed Jaya algorithm is 35 and 50% more accurate as compared to the GRA and TOPSIS method and 67% more accurate as compared to the game theory. The proposed optimization algorithm is simple and requires less computation because it needs fewer control parameters. Due to its simplicity and better accuracy, the decision of network selection is fast which may decrease handoff failure probability and handoff latency. Due to the fast operation of the algorithm, it can be used in the smaller cells for frequent handoff. It is the powerful optimization algorithm which can be used for selection of secondary users in cognitive radio.
