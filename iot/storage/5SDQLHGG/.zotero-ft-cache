Tampa-Hillsborough Expressway Authority (THEA) Pilot

Tampa-Hillsborough Expressway Authority (THEA) owns and operates the Selmon Reversible Express Lanes (REL),

which is a first-of-its-kind facility to address urban congestion. The REL morning commute endpoint intersection is on

major routes into and out of the downtown Tampa commercial business district. Drivers experience significant delay

during the morning peak hour resulting in, and often caused by, a correspondingly large number of rear-end crashes

and red light running collisions. Because the lanes are reversible, wrong way entry is possible.The THEA CV Pilot will

Wyoming (WY) DOT Connected Car Pilot
Wyoming is an important freight corridor that plays a critical role in the movement of goods across the country and between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. As shown in the figure below, Interstate 80 (I-80) in southern Wyoming which is above 6000 feet is a major corridor for east/west freight movement and moves more than 32 million tons of freight per year. During winter seasons when wind speeds and wind gusts exceed 30 mph and 65 mph respectively, crash rates on I-80 have been found to be 3 to 5 times as high as summer crash rates. This resulted in 200 truck blowovers
within 4 years and often led to road closures.road closures.

WYDOT will develop systems that support the use of CV Technology along the 402 miles of I-80 in Wyoming. As listed in

Table 2, approximately 75 roadside units (RSUs) that can receive and broadcast message using Dedicated Short Range

Communication (DSRC) will be deployed along various sections of I-80. WYDOT will equip around 400 vehicles, a

combination of fleet vehicles and commercial trucks with on-board units (OBUs). Of the 400 vehicles, at least 150 would

be heavy trucks that are expected to be regular users of I-80. In addition, of the 400 equipped-vehicles, 100 WYDOT

fleet vehicles, snowplows and highway patrol vehicles, will be equipped with OBUs and mobile weather sensors. units

New York City (NYC) Connected Car Pilot

The NYCDOT leads the New York City Pilot, which aims to improve the safety of travelers and pedestrians in the city through the deployment of V2V and V2I connected vehicle technologies. This objective directly aligns with the city’s Vision Zero initiative. In 2014, NYC began its Vision Zero program to reduce the number of fatalities and injuries resulting from traffic crashesper hour (mph).

The NYCDOT CV Pilot Deployment project area encompasses three distinct

areas in the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn (see the figure below). The

first area includes a 4-mile segment of Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) Drive in

the Upper East Side and East Harlem neighborhoods of Manhattan. The

second area includes four one-way corridors in Manhattan. The third area

covers a 1.6-mile segment of Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn. As shown in Table

Basic Safety Messages (BSM)

BSMs are one of the primary building blocks for V2V communications. They provide situational awareness information to individual vehicles regarding traffic and safety. BSMs are broadcast ten times per second by a vehicle to all neighboring vehicles and are designed to warn the drivers of those vehicles of crash imminent situations.

Vehicular Public Key Infrastructure (VPKI)
V2V communications consists of two types of messages: safety messages and certificate exchange messages. The safety messages are used to support the safety applications, and the certificate exchange messages ensure that the safety message is from a trusted source. The safety messages are transmitted in a standardized format so that they can be read by all other vehicles participating in the network.
NHTSA’s current research is based on the assumption that the V2V system will use a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to authenticate messages, so that other vehicles will trust the message. PKI uses certificates to inform a receiving device that the message is from a trusted source, and it uses cryptography to send encrypted message content. For V2V communications, BSM messages are trusted but not encrypted, while messages that contain security information (e.g., certificates) are trusted and the contents encrypted.

IEEE 1609.2 – Practical Internet of Things Security (Brian Russell)
The US Dept Transportation (USDOT), and academia have been developing CV technology for many years and it will make its commercial debut in the 2017 Cadillac. In a few years, it is likely that most new US vehicles will be outfitted with the technology. The dedicated short range communications (DSRC) wireless protocol (based on IEEE 802.11p) is limited to a narrow set of channels in the 5 GHz frequency band. To accommodate so many vehicles and maintain security, it was necessary to 1) secure the communications using cryptography (to reduce malicious spoofing or eavesdropping attacks) and 2) minimize the security overhead within connected vehicle BSM transmissions. The industry resolved to use a new, slimmer and sleeker digital certificate design.
The 1609.2 certificate format is advantageous in that it is approximately half the size of a typical X. 509 certificate while still using strong, elliptic curve cryptographic algorithms (ECDSA and ECDH). The certificate is also useful for general machine-to-machine communication through its unique attributes, including explicit application identifier (SSID) and credential holder permission (SSP) fields. These attributes can allow IoT applications to make explicit access control decisions without having to internally or externally query for the credential holder's permissions. They're embedded right in the certificate during the secure, integrated bootstrapping and enrollment process with the PKI. The reduced size of these credentials also makes them attractive for other, bandwidth-constrained wireless protocol

This image presents both an initial deployment model as well as a full deployment model. Note that this diagram shows the initial deployment model where there is no Intermediate CA and the Root CA talks to the MA, PCA, and ECA (dotted lines).

Purpose

A short-term digital certificates used by a vehicle’s on-board equipment to authenticate and validate sent and received basic safety messages that form the foundation for V2V safety technologies. These short-term certificates contain no information about users to protect privacy, but serve as credentials that permit users to participate in the V2V
Authorize other Certificate Management Entities (CMEs) (or possibly an Enrollment Certificate Authority [ECA]) using authority from the Root CA, but does not hold the same authority as the Root CA in that it cannot self-sign a certificate.
The linkage values provide the PCA with a means to calculate a certificate ID and a mechanism to connect all short-term certificates from a specific device for ease of revocation in the event of misbehavior
Obscures the location of OBE seeking to communicate with the SCMS functions, so that the functions are not aware of the geographic location of a specific vehicle. All communications from the OBE to the SCMS components must pass through the LOP.
The MA acts as the central function to process misbehavior reports and produce and publish the certificate revocation list. It works with the PCA, RA, and LAs to acquire necessary information about a certificate to create entries to the CRL through the CRL Generator.
Issues the short-term certificates used to ensure trust in the system. In earlier designs their lifetime was fixed at five minutes. The validity period of certificates is still on the order of “minutes” but is now a variable length of time, making them less predictable and thus harder to track.
The RA performs the necessary key expansions before the PCA performs the final key expansion functions. It receives certificate requests from the OBE (by way of the LOP), requests and receives linkage values from the LAs, and sends certificate requests to the PCA

The ROOT CA - master root for all other CAs; it is the “center of trust” of the system. It issues certificates to subordinate CAs in a hierarchical fashion, providing their authentication within the system so all other users and functions know they can be trusted. The Root CA produces a selfsigned certificate (verifying its own trustworthiness) using out-of-band communications

SCMS vs Traditional PKI Models

SCMS is a tailored public key infrastructure (PKI) that is designed to provision PKI certificates to vehicles and infrastructure.The SCMS employs components such as location obscurer proxies (LOPs) that shield vehicle identities from PKI components and by extension operators. Vehicles themselves employ a concept of rotating certificates taken from a pool, and then used to digitally sign messages.
SCMS implements a PKI with some additional new features. This SCMS is currently the leading candidate design for the V2V security backend design in the US, It is distinguished from a traditional PKI in several aspects, the two most important ones being its size (i.e., the number of vehicles that it supports) and the balance among security, privacy, and efficiency. At its full capacity, assuming 300 million vehicles, it will issue approximately 300 billion certificates per year1. The largest current PKI, deployed by the US Department of Defense, is several orders of magnitude smaller and issues under 10 million certificates per year.

SCMS design is significantly different from any previously implemented PKI due to the underlying security

objectives and size, however, it is somewhat similar to the design of the European V2X PKI [2]. The main

TecdhiffeDreancyesVtoI[2] include an increased focus on privacy against attacksf rom SCMS insiders, efficient handling

of revocation, and an efficient method for updating certificates based on the butterfly key expansion algorithm.

SCMS vs Traditional PKI Models (BAH Conceptual Diagram)

Tech Day VI

The CAMP SCMS design features a CA hierarchy, with:

• A root CA that issues certificates for other CAs but not for vehicles or other end-entities

• Optionally, intermediate CAs (ICAs), which obtain their certificates from other CAs above them and also issue certificates for other CAs rather than endentities. The advantage of using intermediate CAs is that if an intermediate CA is compromised, it is less catastrophic than if the root CA is compromised, so this gives the system more flexibility to introduce new CAs without running the risks incurred by using the root CA key. It is possible to use intermediate CAs in a cascade, so an intermediate CA is either validated by the root CA or the intermediate CA above it.

• Enrollment authorities that issue enrollment certificates (long-term certificate signing requests) for the end-entities. These enrollment certificates are used only to communicate with the SCMS, not with other vehicles or end-entities. Note: the lifetime of the certificate is currently assumed to be the lifetime of a car (e.g., 30 years). However, this still needs discussion as it influences the size of the internal blacklist and is hence a cost issue. Note: the certificate lifetime and the lifetime of the actual CA do not have to be equal.

• Pseudonym CAs that issue certificates for the applications on the cars

The CAMP SCMS also distinguishes between the CA,

which actually signs the certificate and the RA, which

approves certificate requests.

A root CA certificate does not have an encryption key as the root CA is mostly offline and does not accept any incoming messages, whether encrypted or not.

SCMS Cryptographic Test Vectors
https://stash.campllc.org/projects/SCMS/repos/crypto-test-vectors

. Linkage Values - To support efficient revocation, end-entity certificates contain a linkage value (LV), which is derived from (cryptographic) linkage seed material. Publication of the seed is sufficient to revoke all certificates belonging to the revoked device, but without the seed an eavesdropper cannot tell which certificates belong to a particular device.

Butterfly Expansion Function - Butterfly Keys are a novel cryptographic construction that allow a device to request an arbitrary number of certificates, each with different signing keys and each encrypted with a different encryption key, using a request that contains only one verification public key seed and one encryption public key seed and two “expansion functions.

Key Derivation Function, KDF2 with SHA-256 - test vectors of HMAC-SHA-256

Message Authentication Code, MAC1 (HMAC) with SHA-256 - Message Authentication Code (MAC) is a short piece of information used to authenticate a message and to provide integrity and authenticity assurances on the message.

AES-CCM-128 Symmetric Authenticated Encryption [IEEE-1609.2] - Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also known as Rijndael (its original name), is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001

ECDH Key Agreement - Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman is a public-key primitive where two parties can compute a shared secret by exchanging public keys and employing them and the corresponding private keys in the computation

ECIES Public-Key Encryption [IEEE-1609.2] - Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme, or ECIES, is a hybrid encryption system proposed by Victor Shoup in 2001. ECIES combines a Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) with a Data Encapsulation Mechanism (DEM). The system independently derives a bulk encryption key and a MAC key from a common secret. Data is first encrypted under a symmetric cipher, and then the cipher text is MAC'd under an authentication scheme. Finally, the common secret is encrypted under the public part of a public/private key pair

Implicit Certificate Generation and Public/Private Keys Reconstruction - Implicit certificates are employed for

pseudonym certificates, enrollment certificates, etc. They do not contain the subject's public key and are not signed by the

issuer, as is the case with explicit certificates, rather they contain a public key reconstruction point that is used to

reconstruct the public key of the subject knowing the public key of the issuer
