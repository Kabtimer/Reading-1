Input Payload size Spread factor Explicit header Low DR optimize Coding rate Preamble symbols Bandwidth

13 bytes Total payload, including (at least) 13 bytes of LoRaWAN header if used SF9 SF12-SF6. Higher means more range and better reception, and more airtime yes no header (1) or with header (0). This is the low-level header that indicates coding rate, payload length and payload CRC presence and can be left out if both sides have these parameters fixed no disabled (0) or enabled (1), intended to correct for clock drift at SF11 and SF12 4 / 5 4/5 - 4/8. This is the error correction coding. Higher values mean more overhead. 8 8 for all regions defined in LoRaWAN 1.0, can be different using plain LoRa
