SensorLab2
Observation Toolchain 
OR HOW NOT TO REINVENT THE WHEEL
• Principles
Describe nodes activity using the event logging format (logging library available for OpenWSN !)
• Declare entities & their properties 
e.g. RPL / DAGRank
• Declare entities relations 
e.g. 802.15.4 neighbour discovery /w address <hex address>
• Declare frames and TX / RX events 
e.g. RPL creates a frame of type DIO
• Notify properties updates 
e.g. RPL DAGRank updated to value 256

Observation Toolchain 
OR HOW NOT TO REINVENT THE WHEEL
• Beneﬁts
Fully generic • Stack instrumentation in a breeze 
(working on the mbed LoRa stack as we speak)
No recoding of the debugging / observation tools • SensorLab2 dissector & visualisation tools already know how to handle your new protocol

The Way forward
Observation Toolchain on IoT-Lab ?
Little modiﬁcation required
• Time-stamping, PCAP encapsulation at the gateway
Beneﬁts
• Same tools for both platforms !
