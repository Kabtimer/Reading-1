Abstract— The emerging technologies for connected vehicles have become hot topics. In addition, connected vehicle applications are generally found in heterogeneous wireless networks. In such a context, user terminals face the challenge of access network selection. The method of selecting the appropriate access network is quite important for connected vehicle applications. This paper jointly considers multiple decision factors to facilitate vehicle-to-infrastructure networking, where the energy efﬁciency of the networks is adopted as an important factor in the network selection process. To effectively characterize users’ preference and network performance, we exploit energy efﬁciency, signal intensity, network cost, delay, and bandwidth to establish utility functions. Then, these utility functions and multi-criteria utility theory are used to construct an energy-efﬁcient network selection approach. We propose design strategies to establish a joint multicriteria utility function for network selection. Then, we model network selection in connected vehicle applications as a multiconstraint optimization problem. Finally, a multi-criteria access selection algorithm is presented to solve the built model. Simulation results show that the proposed access network selection approach is feasible and effective.

applications have received extensive attention. As mentioned in [1]–[3], the emerging technologies for connected vehicles have become hot topics. However, connected vehicle applications are generally used in heterogeneous wireless networks. In such a context, user terminals (without loss of generality, we use the term “user terminals” to denote licensed user terminals) face the challenge of access network selection [4], [5]. Moreover, high energy consumption is an important problem in current communication networks [6]–[11]. For example, with the extensive utilization of videos and big data, vehicle communication terminals need more energy to ﬁnish the communication process. Therefore, how to select the appropriate access network is signiﬁcantly important for connected vehicle applications. This paper studies a vehicle-to-infrastructure networking approach for these applications.
In vehicle-to-infrastructure networking, user terminals (vehicles) have multiple available networks, such as Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), cellar networks, and other wireless networks, which they can select as their access networks. It is very difﬁcult for user terminals to select the appropriate network from multiple available networks. Xie et al. proposed a wireless network selection scheme with a parallel transmission capability [4]. Aymen et al. used fuzzy logic and multi-attribute decision making to present a new network selection algorithm [5]. Prabhavathi and Nithyanandan proposed a distributed reinforcement learning strategy to select the WLAN and WiMAX networks [12]. Xing et al. used neural network theory to design a network selection algorithm [13]. However, these methods face many difﬁculties in selecting an effective access network.
A. Motivation and Contributions
The motivation of this paper is to effectively select the appropriate access network in heterogeneous wireless vehicular networks by considering the multi-criteria utilities. As mentioned in [14] and [15], the high energy consumption of a vehicular network is an important challenge in connected vehicle applications. More importantly, with the emerging requirements and fast-paced development of smart cities, smart transportation, and in-car entertainment, multimedia videos, pictures, photos, real-time trafﬁc and vehicle information, weather information etc. must be quickly uploaded to the data treatment platform for these applications via wireless vehicular networks. For example, when a vehicle accident occurs, quickly reporting the location of an accident to a smart

transportation platform in real time is helpful in saving lives and avoiding the trafﬁc congestion; through in-car terminals, individual mobile phones and other individual mobile devices such as iPads and laptops, users can download and upload entertainment data such as videos and photos to/from their social networks to share them with their friends. Moreover, transportation congestion controls and transportation trafﬁc scheduling based on vehicle-to-infrastructure networking are very helpful in improving city transportation and implementing smart transportation. All these applications need to deliver greater amounts of data. In this paper, we study network selection for vehicle-to-infrastructure networking. In such a case, terminal devices consume more energy. In particular, when there exist multiple mobile devices in a vehicle, the interference among them can lead to higher receiving and transmitting power consumptions. As discussed in [16]–[19], energy efﬁciency has become an important metric for vehicular networks. Thereby, in this paper we consider the energy efﬁciency utility in the network selection process.1 In contrast to previous papers, this makes our work more consistent with practical cases. We combine energy efﬁciency, signal intensity, network cost, delay, and bandwidth metrics to establish the appropriate utility function to capture users’ preferences and network performance. Additionally, dedicated short-range communications (DSRC), which are one-way or two-way short-range to medium-range wireless communication technologies, are used for vehicle-to-vehicle communications in vehicular networks [20]. However, in contrast to DSRC applications in vehicle-to-vehicle communications, in this paper, we mainly study the communication performance of vehicleto-infrastructure networking.
According to the analysis above, we jointly consider multiple decision factors to effectively achieve vehicle-toinfrastructure networking. In this paper, the energy efﬁciency of networks is adopted as an important factor to perform network selection. We propose a multi-constraint optimization model to characterize the multi-criteria network selection problem in vehicle-to-infrastructure heterogeneous wireless networks. A heuristic algorithm is proposed to seek the optimal solution to the model. Our main contributions in this paper are as follows:
• In contrast to previous network selection methods, we take the energy efﬁciency of networks as an important decision factor. Then, we propose a framework for network selection under the energy efﬁciency metric. To obtain the weight of each decision factor, we use the hierarchy analysis method to propose a weight generation algorithm after considering the energy efﬁciency of the networks.
1In this paper, we use the term “user terminals” or “terminals” loosely to refer to mobile devices accessing networks via vehicle-to-infrastructure networking. Here, energy efﬁciency is taken as an important metric, although we know that in reality these devices can be charged or powered by the vehicle’s battery and alternator. However, to deliver larger data ﬂows, terminals require higher energy consumptions. This leads to great loads on vehicles. In turn, bad network selection can increase the transmitting power on the infrastructure side (such as base stations) in vehicle-to-infrastructure networking. As mentioned in [14], energy efﬁciency plays a key role in the optimal design of vehicular techniques deployed in vehicle-to-infrastructure scenarios.

• Multiple decision factors, including energy efﬁciency, signal intensity, network cost, delay, and bandwidth, are jointly considered in the vehicle-to-infrastructure networking. Their utility functions are built to characterize the users’ preferences and network performance. Simultaneously, we give a detailed proof about these utility functions.
• Multi-criteria utility theory is used to construct an energyefﬁcient network selection approach. The design strategies are proposed to establish a joint multi-criteria utility function for network selection. According to the design strategies, we give the design requirements for the multicriteria utility function. Then, the corresponding multicriteria utility function is correctly designed, and a detail proof is given. The network selection for connected vehicle applications is modeled as a multi-constraint optimization problem. Then, we present a heuristic multicriteria access network selection algorithm to obtain the optimal solution to the model. Finally, we conduct detailed simulation experiments to validate the proposed network selection approach.
B. Related Work
To improve the network selection performance, Abid et al. [21] and Lahby and Adib [22] used multiple criteria to build network selection algorithms, namely the Simple Addition Weight (SAW) algorithm and the Random Access Selection (RAS) algorithm. Their studies have shown that SAW and RAS provided a better network selection ability. Kang et al. [23] used DS evidence theory to build a network selection scheme. By constructing the appropriate DS evidence, they could choose the optimal network from many available networks. Tang et al. [24] studied access network selection in multi-cognitive wireless networks. They exploited user preferences, business requirements and network performance to propose an integrated weighting network access selection algorithm. Additionally, Wang and Kuo [25] discussed the mathematical modeling of the network selection. Goudarzi et al. [26] used an artiﬁcial bee colony to seek the optimal solution to the vertical-handover problem, where an iterative process was used to ﬁnd the optimal solver. Chinnappan and Balasubramanian [27] exploited fuzzy logic controllers to perform the vertical handover and used the mobile terminal speed, network load and service cost to decide the users’ satisfaction degrees. Gharsallah et al. [28] proposed a new scheme to select the most appropriate wireless access network for each application. Ahuja et al. [29] took the available bandwidth as a time-varying parameter to perform network selection in heterogeneous wireless contexts. However, these methods do not jointly consider multiple decision factor. Moreover, these methods also do not consider the networks’ energy efﬁciency. As mentioned in [30], energy efﬁciency has an important impact on network performance. Therefore, these methods face difﬁculties in achieving the optimal network selection. Our approach jointly consider multiple decision factors and regards the access networks’ energy efﬁciency as a selection metric.

Xu et al. [31] studied network selection between LTE and WiFi. They proposed a context-aware method to choose the network. Skondras et al. [32] proposed a network selection approach by estimating the weights of decision factors. In each selection process, they considered the impact and dynamic changes in different decision factors. Then, by performing a weight estimation process, they selected the network that satisﬁed their requirements. Goyal and Kaushal [33] exploited the analytic hierarchy process to perform network selection for moving vehicles. Ting et al. [34] studied network selection in the backhaul capacity of small cells and presented a dynamic backhaul-capacity-sensitive network selection method. They took the backhaul capacity and capacity sensitivity as important selection factors. Kuboniwa et al. [35] studied the cell selection in small cells. They exploited the positioning and map information to develop a new selection scheme.Simultaneously, they considers trafﬁc load information and employed the expected throughput and location to select a network. Mah et al. [36] used the Markov Decision Process and related shadow prices to develop a network selection method. Their method exploited operators’ and users’ utilities to jointly consider users’ and operators’ objectives. Accordingly, their method could obtain a better network selection performance. In contrast to these methods, we build a multicriteria utility function and model to characterize the network selection problem in heterogeneous wireless networks.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses network selection for vehicle-toinfrastructure networking. Section 3 derives the utility functions of all the decision factors. In Section 4, we present and discuss a multi-criteria access network selection approach. Section 5 presents the simulation results and analysis. Finally, we conclude our work in Section 6.
II. NETWORK SELECTION FOR VEHICLE-TO-INFRASTRUCTURE NETWORKING
In the section, we will discuss the network selection for vehicle-to-infrastructure networking.
A. Network Selection
To allow user terminals to access the appropriate network, a complex mechanism is required. In the mechanism, user terminals need to ﬁnd available access networks, and an appropriate scheme is built to select an optimal access network for users. Moreover, we also need to guarantee continuous communication for the users.
For the vehicle-to-infrastructure networking case, it is signiﬁcantly important to select the appropriate available network. Therefore, network selection has an important impact on users’ quality of experience. In this paper, the network selection framework for vehicle-to-infrastructure networking is shown in Fig. 1, which includes the modules for data collection, network ﬁltering, the calculation of energy efﬁciency, and the generation of the ﬁtted values. First, the data collection module collects and provides all the parameters that the network selection algorithm needs. In our framework, we collect the parameters about users’ conﬁguration, trafﬁc demands, QoS

requirements, and conﬁguration of operator networks, where trafﬁc demands denote the demands for download and upload trafﬁc. In our framework and method, users decide on and input the QoS requirements. The user terminals or vehicle terminals collect these requirements. Based on these parameters, the measurement metrics about energy efﬁciency, signal intensity, delay, and cost can be calculated appropriately. Second, the network ﬁltering module chooses the networks that satisfy the given constraints and parameter thresholds. Through the network ﬁltering process, the set of available networks is built. Simultaneously, the computational complexity and the decision time can be effectively reduced. Third, we use the module for the calculation of the energy efﬁciency to compute the energy efﬁciency of the available networks according to the network parameters and trafﬁc types. Fourth, the ﬁtted value generation module calculates the selection weight of the available networks. To generate the appropriate and correct selection weight for each metric, we use the hierarchy analysis method to obtain the expected network weight as discussed in [33].
B. Network Weight
In this paper, the decision factors of the network selection include the networks’ energy efﬁciency, signal intensity, delay, cost, and bandwidth. Signal intensity can be determined by the user terminals, while other metrics need to be obtained by network sensing and information collection [24].
To access the optimal network, the network weight is exploited to characterize the network performances and users’ preferences. We use the hierarchy analysis method to allocate the appropriate weight to each selection metric. The steps and

III. UTILITY FUNCTION
To effectively evaluate the decision factors of network selection, we design utility functions to map different decision factors to the corresponding utility metrics. According to utility theory, the utility function is satisﬁed with twice differentiability, monotonicity, and concavity-convexity. Only when three properties are satisﬁed, can we ﬁnd the optimal point according to the designed utility functions. In the following, we design the utility function corresponding to each decision factor.

Fig. 2. The ﬂow chart of the hierarchy analysis method.
E expresses the energy consumption in units of joules; α is a parameter, where 0 < α < 1; rd denotes the energy consumption to transmit K bytes; rt represents the user terminal’s circuit energy consumption per second; b denotes the average transmission rate of the users’ trafﬁc, in units of K byte/s; and ( b) ≤ B, where b denotes the network bandwidth. In Equation (1), rt denotes the basic circuit energy consumption that guarantees that the terminal circuits will perform normally when the terminal is idle, while rd describes the energy consumption only related to the terminal loads when the terminal sends network data.
As mentioned in [30], the sigmoidal function is a good threshold function and is continuous, smooth, and strictly monotonic. Therefore, we use the sigmoidal function to characterize the utility metric of the networks’ energy efﬁciency.
Theorem 1: The sigmoidal utility function, namely

is twice differentiable, monotonic, and concavity-convex. Proof: In the following, we use the mathematical method
to prove that the utility function has twice differentiability, monotonicity, and concavity-convexity.

its ﬁrst derivative can be denoted as

(3)

where γ1 > 0 and β > 0. Therefore, according to Equation (3), we can prove that the
utility function is monotone. According to Equation (3), we obtain its second derivative
as follows:

.

(4)

According to Equation (4), we know that the utility function in Equation (2) is twice differentiable.
Let y ≤ 0; then, the following equation is obtained:

Let y ≤ 0; then, the following equation holds:

≥

γ12β exp γ1 (x0 − x ) (1 + β exp γ1 (x0 − x ))2

(7)

Accordingly, we obtain the following equation:

x ≥ x0 − ln β

According to Equations (5)-(8), we can derive that when

Thus, according to the above discussion, we deﬁne the

utility function of the network’s energy efﬁciency as

(9)

where e and eavg denote the network’s energy efﬁciency and average energy efﬁciency and γ1 (where γ1 ≥ 2) represents the sensitivity of the user’s trafﬁc to the energy efﬁciency, which determines the curve steepness of the utility function. A steeper γ1 results in a higher sensitivity.
The utility function for energy efﬁciency is plotted in Fig. 3. From Fig. 3, we can see that the utility function is monotonic
and concavity-convex. The physical meaning of Equation (9)
is that a higher network energy efﬁciency e results in a larger utility function u(e) and a more preferable network. This shows that the deﬁned utility function u(e) can effectively be used for decision making in network selection.

Fig. 3. The utility function for energy efﬁciency.

B. Utility Function of Signal Intensity
Generally, when the received signal is lower than a certain threshold, it can be considered that the network cannot guarantee normal operation. In such a case, the utility value for the signal intensity is 0. Moreover, the received signal has an upper limit.
The received signal determines the intensity scope. If assuming xα as a lower limit and xβ as an upper limit, we need to consider the upper and lower limits in the utility function. Therefore, for the utility function of the signal intensity, we introduce the following additional conditions:

u (x) = 0 ∀x ≤ xα

(10)

u (x) = 1 ∀x ≥ xβ

(11)

u (xmid ) = 0.5, x = xmid

is twice differentiable, monotonic, and concavityconvex. In addition, it satisﬁes with the constraints in Equations (10)-(12).

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS

Proof: According to Equation (14), we can observe

that the utility function satisﬁes the constraints in Equa-

tions (10)-(12). Next, we prove that it is twice differentiable,

monotonic, and concavity-convex.

To prove the twice differentiability, we only need to prove

that the second and third equations in Equation (14) are

differentiable.

According to Equation (14), the following equation holds:

lim u
x →xm+id

(x )

=

γ2 4 (xmid − xmin)

(15)

lim u (x) =

γ2

(16)

x →xm−id

4 (xmax − xmid )

Therefore, we can obtain the following equation

lim u (x) = lim u (x)

x →xm+id

x →xm−id

As a result, the utility function in Equation (14) is twice

differentiable. Simultaneously, we can easily ﬁnd that it is also

monotonic and concavity-convex.

The proof is concluded.

Here, we obtain the utility function of the signal intensity

as follows:

(17)

where smin and smax denote the lower and upper limits of the signal intensity, respectively; γ2 (where γ2 ≥ 2) represents the sensitivity; and

smid

=

(smin

+ smax) 2

The physical meaning of Equation (17) is that a higher

signal intensity s results in a larger utility function u(s) and

a more preferable network. This shows that the deﬁned utility

function u(s) can effectively be used for network selection.

Fig. 4 shows the utility function for signal intensity.

C. Utility Function of Cost
Network cost is a more intuitive metric for the user. The cost of different networks can be compared directly with each other. In this paper, we use a linear function to denote the utility function of cost. Hence, it can be expressed as

u (c) = 1 − u (c)

(18)

where

⎧ ⎨

c

,

u (c) = ⎩1c,max

0 ≤ c ≤ cmax c > cmax

c is the current cost of the network, and cmax is the maximum cost acceptable to the user.

Fig. 4. The utility function for signal intensity.

The physical meaning of Equation (18) is that a lower cost c results in a larger utility function u(c) and a more preferable network. This shows that the deﬁned utility function u(c) can effectively be used for network selection. Fig. 5 plots the utility function for the cost.

D. Utility Function for Network Delay
Generally, network delay should have a maximum value. When designing the utility function, we expect that a larger network delay has a lower the corresponding utility value. The network delay criterion is a decreasing metric. Therefore, we deﬁne the utility function for the network delay as

u

(d )

(19)

where dmax represents the maximum delay, dm is half of the maximum delay, and γ3 (where γ3 ≥ 2) denotes the sensitivity. A greater value of γ3 results in a greater sensitivity.
The utility function for the network delay is similar to
that for the signal intensity, which is twice differentiable, monotonic, and concavity-convex. Due to space limitations,
the detailed proof process is not given. The physical meaning
of Equation (19) is that a higher cost d results in a larger utility function u(d) and a more preferable network. This shows that the deﬁned utility function u(d) can effectively be used for network selection.

E. Utility Function for Network Bandwidth
When the network bandwidth is lower than the minimum requirements of the user’s trafﬁc, this will cause a loss of the user’s requests. This is very difﬁcult for users to tolerate.

When the network bandwidth is higher than the maximum

requirements of the user’s trafﬁc, the user’s satisfaction degree

will not increase further. Therefore, we deﬁne the following

utility function for network bandwidth:

where bmin and bmax represent the minimum and maximum network bandwidths, respectively, and b denotes the bandwidth of the user’s demands. The utility function for the network delay is similar to that for the signal intensity. Due to space limitations, the detailed proof process is not given. The physical meaning of Equation (20) is that a higher cost b results in a larger utility function u(b) and a more preferable network. This shows that the deﬁned utility function u(b) can effectively be used for network selection.
Thus, according to the above discussion and design, for metric factors concerning energy efﬁciency, signal intensity, network cost, delay, and bandwidth, we can effectively design corresponding utility functions that are twice differentiable, monotonic, and concavity-convex. As a result, according to these designed utility functions, we can select the appropriate access network.

IV. MULTI-CRITERIA ACCESS SELECTION
In this section, we will derive our network selection approach: Multi-Criteria Access Selection (MCAS). For connected vehicle applications in vehicle-to-infrastructure networking as shown in Fig. 6, where V denotes the moving vehicle, when the vehicle V is moving to position P1 from left to right, there are six available networks, including three

WLAN networks, two 3G networks and one WiMax network. At Position P1, it seems that it is the most appropriate for vehicle V to select network B1. However, if there exists greater interference and channel congestion, other networks may be better suited for the vehicle V . When vehicle V moves from position P1 to positions P2 and P3, the available networks are different at these different positions. In such a case, many factors, including energy efﬁciency, signal intensity, network cost, delay, and bandwidth, are considered.
Therefore, when designing the multi-criteria utility function, we need to consider how multiple selection metrics affect each other in the decision process. Therefore, we propose the following design strategies:
Strategy 1: If one of the multiple metrics of the network has a weight value of greater than zero, the multi-criteria utility function can characterize the impact between multiple metrics on network selection.
Strategy 2: If one of the multiple metrics of the network has a weight value of zero, the multi-criteria utility function can reﬂect this feature of the network. In addition, the multicriteria utility value can effectively be used to perform decision making in network selection.
Strategy 3: The utility function can reﬂect the monotonicity of each metric. In addition, it ensures that the utility value cannot be greater than one.
Strategy 4: The utility function is used to avoid the zerocost effect. It can correctly reﬂect the selection preferences of users.
According to the design strategies above, we deﬁne the following design requirements for the multi-criteria utility function:

Equation (21) ensures that the multi-criteria utility function increases with monotonic increases in each utility function. In such a case, our multi-criteria utility function can sufﬁciently characterize the impact of each selection factor. Equation (22) indicates that the multi-criteria utility function decreases with monotonic decreases in each utility function. Equation (23) shows that the multi-criteria utility function trends to zero when one of multiple metrics gradually becomes zero. Equation (24) guarantees that the multi-criteria utility function trends to one when all multiple metrics gradually become one. Speciﬁcally, this illustrates that all utility metrics are based on the users’ expectations. Finally, we set the weight concerning the users’ preferences to reﬂect their individual preferences.

A. Multi-Criteria Utility Function

In this section, we propose a new multi-criteria utility function and prove that it satisﬁes all the requirements in Equations (21)-(24) and is built according to the utility functions of the ﬁve decision factors in Equations (1)-(20).
Theorem 3: For the multi-criteria utility function

n

U (x ) = [ui (xi )]wi

(25)

i =1

where n is the number of dimensions of vector x, wi denotes

the initial weight of metric i (where (

n i =1

wi )

=

1),

ui (xi )

stands for the utility value of metric i , it satisﬁes the con-

straints in (21)-(24).

Proof: For ∀ j = 1, . . . , n, when u j → 0, U (x) =

n i =1

ui

(xi

)wi

=

0.

Therefore, the utility function in (25) satisﬁes the constraint

in Equation (23).

When u1, . . . , un → 1, U (x ) =

n i =1

ui

(xi

)wi

=

1.

This indicates that Equation (25) satisﬁes the constraint in

Equation (24).

The partial differential of the utility function in (25) with

respect to u j is calculated as follows:

∂U (x) ∂u j

= wj

uj

xj

(w j −1) n ui (xi )wi
i=j

≥0

(26)

Therefore, the utility function in Equation (25) satisﬁes the constraint in Equation (21).
The partial derivative of U (x) in Equation (25) with respect to x j can be obtained as follows:

∂U (x) = ∂xj

wj uj xj

(w j −1) n [ui (xi )]wi
i=j

uj xj

(27)

This illustrates that the utility function in Equation (25) satisﬁes the constraint in Equation (22).
Therefore, from Equations (26)-(27), we can know that when each utility function monotonically increases or decreases, the multi-criteria utility function possesses the same monotonic properties.
Finally, it is proved that the multi-criteria utility function can be used to reﬂect the users’ preferences. The logarithmic transformation cannot cause a change in the priority. Therefore, U (x) in Equation (25) is logarithmically transformed.

Then, we obtain the following equation:

n

V (x) = ln (u (x)) = wi ln (u (x))

(28)

i =1

According to Equation (28), let vi (xi ) = ln ui (xi ). It is clear that vi (xi ) = ln ui (xi ) is also a one-metric utility function. Then, the following equation can be obtained:

n

V (x ) = wi vi (xi ) ∼ U (x )

(29)

i =1

From Equation (29), it can be known that the users’ preferences can be reﬂected by setting appropriate weight values. This indicates that the utility function in Equation (25) can effectively characterize users’ preferences.
The proof is concluded. According to Theorem 3, the utility function in Equation (25) satisﬁes the requirements of the multi-criteria utility function and can be used to build our multi-criteria utility function for vehicle-to-infrastructure networking. In the following, we will discuss our access selection model for this application.

B. Access Selection Model

According to the discussion above, we propose the following access selection model:

Equation (30) describes an optimal model, Equation (30a) denotes the objective function obtained according to the multicriteria utility function in Equation (25), Equation (30b) indicates the constraints of the normalized coefﬁcients of n access networks, Equations (30c-30d) give the weight constraints of network i , Equation (30e) denotes the constraint of parameter α, Equation (30f) is the bandwidth constraint, Equation (30g) represents the cost constraint, Equation (30h) is the constraint for the signal intensity, Equation (30i) stands for the delay constraint, and Equations (30j-m) denote the constraints of parameters r1 and r2.

C. Selection Algorithm
The optimal model of network selection in Equation (30) is built according to the utility functions of ﬁve decision factors in Equations (1)-(20), which is a multi-constraint optimal model. It is quite difﬁcult to solve the optimal model. Therefore, we propose a heuristic Multi-Criteria Access Selection (MCAS) algorithm. The ﬂow chart of MCAS is shown in Fig. 7. The steps of the MCAS algorithm are detailed as follows:

Or reject the request of user m, and go to Step 10.

V. SIMULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
In this section, we conduct a series of tests to validate our MCAS algorithm for vehicle-to-infrastructure networking applications using the NS3 simulation platform. The simulation scenario is such that the user is in the coverage areas of three types of wireless access networks, namely, the 3G cellular network, WLAN network and WiMAX network. As mentioned in [21], [22], [26], [27], and [37], the basic parameters of the three networks are listed in Table 1, where the notations “si” and “bw” denote “signal intensity” and “bandwidth”. As shown in Table 1, for 3G, WiMAX, and WLAN, their bandwidths (in Mbps) are 3, 12, and 6, respectively; their transmitting power values (W) are 0.86687, 0.90000, and 0.62815, respectively; and their energy efﬁciency values (J/KB) are 0.01540, 0.02000, and 0.00412, respectively. From Table 1, we can see that each network possesses different advantages and disadvantages. The WiMAX access network is expensive, although it provides a larger bandwidth and lower network delay. The 3G access network is cheap, but its performance is not satisfactory. The WLAN access network

provides a generally good performance, and it requires a lower energy consumption.
In the simulation scenario, we analyze four different types of applications, including voice, video, web downloads, and online games. Without loss of generality, all the required bandwidth and duration times are ﬁxed. As mentioned in [21] and [37]–[39], the detailed parameters of all the applications are listed in Table 2, where the notations “du”, “bwd”, and “sod” denote “duration”, “bandwidth demand”, and “sensitivity of delay”, respectively. As listed in Table 2, for voice,

video, downloads, and games, their duration values (in min)

are 5, 10, 10, and 20, respectively, while their bandwidth

demand values (Mbps) are 0.1 − 0.2, 1 − 2, 0 − 0.2, and

0.4 − 0.8, respectively. It is reported that the SAW and RAS

algorithms achieve good network selection performance for

wireless access applications [21], [22]. These algorithms are

two important multi-criteria utility network selection algo-

rithms for heterogeneous wireless environments. SAW and

RAS could obtain better performances in the network selection

process, but they still suffers from certain disadvantages. First,

SAW used U (x) =

n i =1

wi

ui

(xi )

(where

n i =1

wi

=

to

calculate the selection weight, while it independently used

each decision factor to select the target network. Accord-

ingly, SAW could avoid selecting a network with a cer-

tain utility value being zero, namely, ∃i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} :

lim U (x) = 0. Second, RAS exploited the acceptance
ui (xi )→0
probability A (u, p) = 1 − exp −Cuμ p−ε to decide whether

the satisfaction degree of utility u could be accepted after

expending a certain cost p, where μ > 0 and ε > 0 denoted

the users’ sensitivity to the utility u and cost p, and C

was a positive constant representing the referred satisfaction

degree. RAS avoided the shortcoming of SAW, although it

suffered from the zero cost effect: p→0 A (u, p) = 1 (where ∀u > 0). Furthermore, RAS only considered a single metric

in calculating the utility u. Additionally, RAS could use the

utility function to reﬂect the users’ preference. To validate

the performance of our MCAS algorithm, we compare MCAS

with those two algorithms. Mah et al. [36] discussed the

energy consumption of android phones, whereas in this paper,

we validate our method according to the simulation parameters

in Tables 1 and 2.

A. Performance Analysis
Fig. 8 shows the users’ trafﬁc allocation on different access networks under the MCAS algorithm. When trafﬁc requests are low, the WLAN undertakes most of the trafﬁc requests. When the number of trafﬁc requests increases, the percentage of trafﬁc allocated to the WLAN gradually decreases, while that of the WiMAX access network increases. In such a case, the percentage of trafﬁc allocated to the 3G access network initially increases but then decreases. It is very interesting that the WLAN is always in charge of delivering substantially more trafﬁc requests that the 3G and WiMAX access networks. In contrast to WLAN and 3G access networks, WiMAX forwards the fewest trafﬁc requests. This is reasonable because the WLAN has the lowest cost and energy consumption as well as higher bandwidth compared to the other two access networks. Moreover, MCAS takes energy

efﬁciency as an important selection metric in the network selection process. Therefore, MCAS always allocates trafﬁc requests to the WLAN as a priority. When the number of trafﬁc requests increases, the WLAN does not have sufﬁcient network resources to provide to user terminals. In such a case, some of the trafﬁc requests are allocated to the 3G and WiMAX networks. This indicates that MCAS achieves a better performance for network selection.
Next, we analyze the energy consumption of MCAS for different access networks. Fig. 9 plots the energy consumption distribution when the number of trafﬁc requests gradually increases. It is very clear that when trafﬁc requests increase, the energy consumption of the WLAN slowly decreases. However, in such a case, the energy consumption of WiMAX gradually increases, while that of the 3G access network ﬁrst increases and then slowly decreases. More importantly, when the number of trafﬁc requests is greater than 18, the energy consumption of the WLAN is lower than those of the other two access networks. When there are between 16 and 22 trafﬁc requests, the energy consumption of the 3G access network is larger than that of the WLAN and WiMAX. When there are fewer than 16 trafﬁc requests, the WLAN shows the highest energy consumption. According to Table 1, we can see that

Fig. 11. Energy consumption of three algorithms.

when the number of trafﬁc requests is smaller, MCAS ﬁrst selects the WLAN as the optimal available access network. Because the WLAN undertakes most of the trafﬁc requests in such a case, it expends the highest amount of energy. In addition, MCAS uses multiple metrics as the optimal utility value to select the optimal access network. Thereby, when faced with many trafﬁc requests, some trafﬁc requests will be allocated to the two other access networks according to the multi-criteria selection strategies. Compared to the two other access networks, the percentage of energy consumption of the WLAN will decrease slowly. This illustrates that MCAS can indeed select the appropriate access network to facilitate data packet delivery to achieve energy savings.
B. Performance Comparison
Now, we compare the performance of three algorithms under different numbers of trafﬁc requests. Here, we discuss their energy efﬁciency, energy consumption, average satisfaction degree, and failure times during network selection. Fig. 10 plots the energy efﬁciency of three algorithms when the number of trafﬁc requests changes. From Fig. 10, we can see that for different numbers of trafﬁc requests, the energy efﬁciency curve of MCAS is always higher than those of the SAW and RAS algorithms, while that of RAS is at the bottom. This is because MCAS considers the energy efﬁciency as a decision metric in the network selection process, while SAW and RAS do not consider the energy efﬁciency metric in their network selection processes. Moreover, with increasing trafﬁc requests, the energy efﬁciency of the three algorithms also gradually increases. Fig. 10 demonstrates that MCAS possesses a better energy efﬁciency performance than SAW and RAS.
Fig. 11 analyzes the energy consumption performance of the three algorithms for different numbers of trafﬁc requests. Because MCAS takes energy efﬁciency as a decision factor in network selection, Fig. 11 indicates that MCAS achieves the lowest energy consumption when the number of trafﬁc requests increases. SAW exhibits a higher energy consumption, while RAS expends the most energy of the three

algorithms. Furthermore, it is very clear that when the number of trafﬁc requests is increasing, the energy consumption of the three algorithms also increases. This is because more trafﬁc requests leads to more energy necessary to ﬁnish the data packet delivery. In contrast to RAS and SAW, MCAS expends much less energy for different trafﬁc request scenarios. This further indicates that MCAS provides a better energy savings performance than other two algorithms.
To more effectively compare the performance of the three algorithms, we discuss the average satisfaction degree of the users. Fig. 12 plots the users’ average satisfaction degree under the three algorithms with gradually increasing numbers of trafﬁc requests. When the number of trafﬁc requests becomes large, the average satisfaction degree of the three algorithms gradually decreases. This is because additional network resources are required when additional trafﬁc requests are introduced. In such a case, this necessarily degrades the satisfaction degree of the users. However, the average satisfaction degree of SAW decreases quickly, while MCAS and RAS show nearly no change for different trafﬁc request scenarios. Moreover, in contrast to RAS, MCAS shows a lower change in the average satisfaction degree of the users. This is because the multi-criteria utility function of MCAS considers the multiple decision factors and the preferences of the users. In addition, RAS thinks that the individual decision factors are independent, while SAW uses the acceptation probability to characterize users’ satisfaction degrees. Accordingly, Fig. 12 also indicates that when the number of trafﬁc requests is increasing, MCAS achieves the largest average satisfaction degree. Compared to MCAS, SAW exhibits a lower average satisfaction degree, while RAS’s average satisfaction degree is the lowest. This illustrates that MCAS can effectively select an appropriate access network to meet the users’ requirements and preferences. In addition, it can provide users with a higher quality of experience.
Finally, to verify the correctness of network selection and the stability of the algorithms, we repeatedly run a scenario with 30 trafﬁc requests 10-100 times. This is equivalent to 300-3000 executions of the network selection process. Fig. 13 shows the failure times of the network selection

process for the three algorithms in such a case. From Fig. 13, we can ﬁnd that in this process, MCAS has no failures during network selection, while SAW and RAS present more failure times. In particular, when the number of executions increases, the failure times of SAW slowly increase, while those of RAS increase quickly. This is because MCAS jointly consider the mutual impact of multiple decision factors. In contrast to MCAS, RAS independently uses the individual decision factors, while SAW also independently considers each utility metric and suffers from the zero-cost utility problem. Therefore, this indicates that MCAS provides a much better network selection ability and better stability than SAW and RAS.
C. Handover Cost
Next, we discuss the handover cost generated by the three network selection algorithms. As mentioned in [40] and [41], the average assigned bandwidth and average handover latency are used to characterize the network handover performance. Fig. 14 plots the average assigned bandwidth of the three algorithms with gradually increasing the number of trafﬁc requests. Here, the average assigned bandwidth denotes the bandwidth that is assigned to users or vehicle terminals under the constraints of meeting trafﬁc request demands. To avoid the

effects of outliers, we run 100 simulations for each algorithm to obtain the average assigned bandwidth. A lower average assigned bandwidth means that we assign to users or vehicle terminals lower bandwidth to ﬁnish trafﬁc requests. Accordingly, the lower average assigned bandwidth shows that the network selection algorithms can effectively utilize fewer network resources to complete trafﬁc requests. With increasing numbers of trafﬁc requests, the average assigned bandwidth of the three algorithms gradually decreases. This is because more network resources are required to deliver more requests. As a result, each request is necessarily assigned less network bandwidth. It is clear that the average assigned bandwidth of SAW and RAS is quickly decreasing, while that of MCAS is only gradually decreasing. Moreover, compared to SAW and RAS, MCAS shows a smaller bandwidth change. This is because MCAS jointly consider multiple utility factors in the network selection process. Moreover, Fig. 14 shows that when the number of trafﬁc requests is increasing, MCAS provides the lowest average assigned bandwidth. In contrast to MCAS, SAW exhibits a larger average assigned bandwidth, while RAS shows the largest average assigned bandwidth. This illustrates that MCAS can effectively select the appropriate access network, leading to the lowest handover cost.

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS

Fig. 15 indicates the average handover latency under the three network selection algorithms. From Fig. 15, we can see that the average handover latency of the three algorithms is increasing with increasing numbers of trafﬁc requests. It is interesting that MCAS leads in terms of handover latency with gradual changes, while that of SAW and RAS increase quickly. Additionally, Fig. 15 shows that MCAS achieves the lowest handover latency, followed by SAW and then RAS. This is because MCAS jointly considers the mutual impact of multiple decision factors. Moreover, If the networks satisfy the users’ requirements, MCAS does not perform network selection, which avoids the handover process without affecting the users’ demands and accordingly reduces the handover cost. Therefore, this shows that MCAS provides a substantially better network selection performance.
VI. CONCLUSION
This paper studies the network selection problem in heterogeneous wireless networks for vehicle-to-infrastructure networking. In contrast to previous methods, we jointly consider multiple decision factors to facilitate vehicle-to-infrastructure networking. The energy efﬁciency of the networks is taken as an important factor in the network selection. We regard energy efﬁciency, signal intensity, network cost, delay, and bandwidth as decision factors. Their utility functions are built to characterize the users’ preferences and network performance. Multicriteria utility theory is used to construct an energy-efﬁcient network selection approach. We propose several design strategies to construct a joint multi-criteria utility function for network selection. We also present a multi-constraint optimal model to describe the network selection for connected vehicle applications. A multi-criteria access selection algorithm is presented to solve the model. The simulation results show that the proposed access network selection approach is promising.
