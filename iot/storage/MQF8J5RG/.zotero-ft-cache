Navigo
Navigo is a location based packet forwarding mechanism for vehicular Named Data Networking (NDN)
Navigo discovers the geographic area where the data resides It proposes an algorithm to guide the data requests along the shortest path on the V2V channel over the road topology

NDN - the best ﬁt for VANET

NDN puts

at the center of its communication model

contents

IP is host centric: it has di culties coping with mobility and

multihoming

Naming data decouples communication from speciﬁc interfaces and endpoints.

NDN naturally supports multihoming and mobility.

Each application names the data it wants to fetch or provide

The network directly uses these names to process the packets

NDN in VANET
V-NDN: the ﬁrst implementation of NDN for VANET It introduces a 2.5 Link Adaptation Layer (LAL) which: Enables NDN over 802.11-broadcast Provides reliability capabilities and duplicate suppression Limitations: lack of smart packet forwarding mechanism

Naming geographic areas
The world is divided into regions according to the Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) Each area is named with a label
i.e. 4QFJ 123 678 identiﬁes a 100x100 meters area
10 / 46

Mapping data names to geo-areas
Navigo discovers the location (area) of the Data provider (i.e. producer, RSU, caches) and binds it with the Data names
The Interest is sent in all the directions if no information about the name is present Data provider attaches its location (MGRS area label) to the Data Nodes learn the new binding
11 / 46

GeoFaces
In the NDN architecture there is no such thing as geo-areas
The forwarding process is based on the FIB, which stores names-faces pairs only Navigo introduces the concept of geographical faces (GeoFace): an abstraction to the network physical interface
It binds each geo-area to a GeoFace GeoFace A sends packets only towards the geo-area A and receives Data generated from geo-area A only The FIB stores the binding among data names and GeoFaces An application may bind a name with a GeoFace

Interest forwarding
Forwarding Interest I for a Content named N
No match in the FIB ! Interest ﬂooding If the Content N comes back from geo-area X ! registers N-F X into the FIB
Only 1 GeoFaces F X for N With probability p (0.95) ! use F X to forward I With probability 1-p ! Exploration phase: ﬂood I
Multiple GeoFaces for N ! round robin among the faces If I is not satisﬁed within a certain amount of time ! remove the binding GeoFace-N

Shortest path
Road topology as forwarding graph
Using cars as building block of a path exposes the communication to vehicles movement Using roads as path for the packet is more reliable Navigo uses Dijkstra on the road graph to compute the shortest path to reach a destination area Main roads have priority over small streets

Waiting timer
A node postpones a packet transmission based on its position and the type of packet
Data has priority over Interest Cars at the intersection have priority Farther is a car from the previous hop, less it waits
