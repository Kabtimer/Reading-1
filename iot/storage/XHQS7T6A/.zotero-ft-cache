Game Changer: IEEE 802.11-2012 OCB @ 5.9 GHz
• In 1994, the US Federal Communication Commission (FCC) allocated a 16 MHz band (unlicensed) at 902 MHz for ETC called Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC)
– In Europe, DSRC has been introduced solely for ETC at 5.8 GHz
• In 1999, the FCC allocated a second DSRC frequency band at 5.9 GHz to be used specifically for inter-vehicular communication.
– Primary Application:
• Saving lives by avoiding accident • Saving money by reducing traffic congestion
– Secondary Application:
• Comfort (infotainment) application to ease the early deployment of this technology.
• Since 2001 Japan has developed, implemented and deployed DSRC applications under the name ARIB STD T-75 & 88.
• The European Commission allocated a 30 MHz frequency band at 5.9 GHz for safety applications in August 2008

Communication outside of a BSS
• For BSS:
– A station can only respond to an AP communication • once it joined the BSS of the AP OR • if the message is a wildcard BSSID AND it is a broadcast message
• OCB:
– A STA MUST accept and respond to communication from other STAs • Broadcast AND Unicast
– A STA in OCB does not have a valid BSSID
– Use the wildcard BSSID : 0xFFFFFF

802.11 - MAC management functions

• Synchronization
– try to find a LAN, try to stay within a LAN – timer etc.

• Association/Re-association
– integration into a LAN – roaming, i.e. change networks by changing access points – scanning, i.e. active search for a network
• Power management
– sleep-mode without missing a message – periodic sleep, frame buffering, traffic measurements
• Coordination Function (CF) Mode
– Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) – Contention Phase – Polling Coordination Function (PCF) – Contention-free Phase

• Beacon messages
– Used to coordinate the various management functions between AP and STA • BSS
– Contains information to • Synch • Communication Quality • Sleep mode • DCF/PCF modes

• MIB - Management Information Base

DSRC/ITS-G5 OCB mode – Synchronization and Scanning
• Management Frames:
– Beacon frames are not used in DSRC/ITS-G5 • Beacons include information related to a BSS and are mostly not required in OCB
– New Frame: • Timing Advertisement (TA) frame – Kind of replacement for a beacon for transmission of higher layer data (vendor specific) – TSF function can be sent in such frame
– Other beacon related information are transmitted by higher layers (Wave Service Announcements (WSA) for instance)
• Synchronizing
– 802.11p OCB does not require to be synchronized • Power management not supported • High mobility / topology changes
– Yet, a synchronization between stations may be provided by higher layers (1609.x, GPS) is required • Multi-channel operation (only supported by US IEEE WAVE so far)
• Scanning
– Scanning is not required, as the CCH is the reference channel.

IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF)
• Listen before Talk Principle
– If medium is free for a DIFS time, station sends data or control packet – receivers acknowledge at once (after waiting for SIFS) if the packet was received correctly
(CRC) – automatic retransmission of data packets in case of transmission errors
• Contention-based Access
– Contend for the channel access, back-off if you loose

IEEE 802.11 DCF – Back-off Strategy
• Back-off Algorithm
– Defer time = DIFS + Random Time Period – Random Time Period = Int (CW* random()) * aSlot time
• CW is the Contention Window: Its initial value is 31 (size 32) and can take the following values:
– 31, 63, 127, 255, 1023
• Back-off decrementation strategy:
– Back-off counter should be decremented when medium is free – Back-off counter is never decremented when medium is busy

DSRC/ITS-G5 Channel Characterization
• How does the channel characteristic at 5.9 GHz for 802.11p look like?

Delay spread Coherence Bandwidth Coherence Time Doppler spread

~ 0.8 µs ~ 1.25 MHz ~ 1.02 ms ~ 2 kHz

• What does it tell us?

Source: Measurement and Analysis of Wireless Channel Impairments in DSRC Vehicular Communications, Laberteaux et al, 2008

– We have a time- and frequency-selective channel

– We have a doppler spread which needs to be considered

• Actions:
– We have to use narrow-band communication to mitigate frequency-selective channel
– We have to make sure that successive OFDM symbols are sufficiently separated in time to avoid ISI
– We have to make sure that the 52 OFDM sub-carriers are have an inter-carrier distance of at least 2 kHz to avoid ICI

DSRC/ITS-G5 PHY Countermeasures

• Mitigating Inter-Carrier Interference
– 802.11p OFDM uses a carrier spacing of 156.25 kHz – The Doppler Spread of 2 kHz is easily covered by this spacing

• Mitigating Time-selectivity (or narrowband fast fading)

– Problem: the channel estimation at the beginning of a packet may be

invalid at the end of the packet

channel

estimation

packet

time

• This results in an increased Bit error rate and decreased Packet reception rate

– Several solutions:
• Increase data-rate to reduce transmission time below channel coherence time
• Estimate the channel several times during the transmission
• Use modulation schemes which overcome the channel fading, e.g. differential BPSK

Enhancing the Reliability of DSRC
• Vehicular Communication on DSRC are challenging for the following reasons:
– Safety-critical application require ‘periodic TX’ • DSRC has been optimized for busty traffic
– Unacknowledged broadcast traffic – reliable for low traffic density • All cars TX at 10Hz up to 500m – congested channel
– Hidden Terminal – DSRC cannot detect a transmission on the channel • Solutions exist for Unicast; not for Broadcast • Low mutual mobility & Similar transmit range – Recurring hidden terminal on same nodes

• The underlying challenge:
– Reliable 1-hop broadcast !! • In space & in time

Dependable 1-Hop Broadcast
• Reminder: WLAN does not provide real QoS services
– Using broadcast: not any feedback on correct transmission ! – Need to ‘trust’ WLAN
• Rule of thumb:
– The IEEE 802.11p system works fine at ‘low’ channel load – How low??

Controlling Congestion on Wireless Channel

• Sensing:
– Channel load – representing the quality of the wireless channel
• Control:
– Adjusting transmit power, transmit rate or relay selections
• Methodology:
– Efficient and stable evaluation of channel congestion: • Provide close-to-reality channel quality estimation • Provide stable values • Oscillations must be avoided – Control influences the channel in return !! – Trend: Sacrifice accuracy over stability
– Mitigation of channel congestion • Reducing number of bits transmitted on the channel

Measuring Channel Load
• Channel Load metric:
– Channel Busy Time (CBT) – ratio of CCA busy/idle over time
• Measuring mechanisms:
– Adjusting window measurement – Adjusting sampling rate (CCA samples)
• Optimization:

• Load on Channel:

Emergency (DENM)

CAM
Load on Channel

– Per node: bits transmitted by neighbors load a node‘s Channel

– CAM periodically transmitted: major contributor to the load on the Channel

– The higher the load from CAM: the harder it is for DENM to be decoded

• Need to regulate the load generated on Channel
– Topology Control: controlling the number of transmitters – Congestion Control: all transmitters transmit
• Temporal Influence: number of bits transmitted • Spatial influence: distance reached by transmitted bits

Transmit Power Control (TPC) to mitigate Channel Load
• TPC: Locally measure channel load
– If too high, reduce transmit power by one step.. – If too low, increase transmit power..

• Observations:

• Conclusion:

– Channel Sensing requires remote knowledge
• Information must be exchanged between nodes !
– Transmit power adjustments only impact neighbors

– TPC power adjustments are a good option. But:
• Must obtain a networked channel sensing
– Challenge: delayed and inconsistent values

• Cooperative strategies to gain local benefits !

• Must cooperate with other devices

– Challenge: selfishness !!

Limitation of TPC for C-ITS Applications
• High Channel Load
– Reduction of TX power • Might not provide the required range for Safety applications
• Multi-hop not beneficial
– Need a different approach

• Awareness Control:
– Fix Transmit power to cover the required range – Adjust the channel load with transmit rate
• Change of paradigm:
– Range depends on mobility, not load ! – Adjusting rate should not be done based on
channel measurements, but application context ! (ex. Mobility)

Transmit Power Control (TPC) to mitigate Channel Load
• Transmit Rate Control (TRC)
– Keep TX power fixed, adapt TX rate
• In the US and in EU, TRC is considered as a best option to efficiently control congestions
– But they do not share the methodology to reach that target
• Strategies:
– US CAMP • Transmit as much as you can !
– EU C2C-CC • Transmit as much as you need !

Channel Load

• Two Algorithms:
– Table-driven Rate Control

Target capacity

• TX rate is restricted per channel load step

– EU C2C-CC

• TX rate is adapted to the remaining load available

Reliable DSRC in Space & Time – Getting the Cake and eating it too !
• Considering reliable DSRC communication – tradeoff
– High reliability in space but not in time – High reliability in time, but not in space
• Need smart Transmit Strategies
– Safety-critical applications do not need both space and time high reliability !

• Random TX Power and Spatial Awareness
– Showed we could have a higher reliability & a lower congestion
• We could get the cake AND eat it too !!

– Static Sensors: induction loops, pressure sensors, cameras • Small scale, real-time traffic estimation
– Floating (cellular) Car Data (FCD): vehicles/smartphones periodically send their GPS position to the cloud • Large scale (city/area wide), ‘soft’ real time traffic estimation

• Applications:

Exit Zone N

– Dynamic route planning, road traffic information

• FCD very efficient and widely used

Exit Zone W

Entry Zone E

– Smart Traffic Lights: • FCD not adapted • Static Sensors not always reliable / too expensive
