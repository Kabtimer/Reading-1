I. INTRODUCTION
To cope with the rapid growth of mobile broadband trafÔ¨Åc, different radio access technologies (e.g., HSPA, LTE, WiFi and WiMAX) are being integrated and jointly managed. So as to optimize resource utilization, while enhancing user experience (Always Best Connected concept [1]), efÔ¨Åcient Common Radio Resource Management (CRRM) mechanisms need to be deÔ¨Åned. Typically, when a new or a handover session arrives, a decision must be made as to what technology it should be associated with. This is known as the Radio Access Technology (RAT) selection, a key CRRM functionnality.
In order to consider operator objectives, including efÔ¨Åcient exploitation of radio resources, network-centric schemes have been proposed: network elements collect necessary measurements and information. They take selection decisions transparently to end-users in a way to enhance heterogeneous network performance [2]‚Äì[6]. However, to reduce network complexity, signaling and processing load, user-centric methods have also gained in importance: based on their individual needs and preferences, rational users select their access technology in a way to selÔ¨Åshly maximize their payoff (utility) [6]‚Äì[12]. Because individual users have no information on the global network state (i.e., network load conditions), user-centric approaches are known for their potential inefÔ¨Åciency.
In this article, we propose a hybrid decision method that combines beneÔ¨Åts from both network-centric and user-centric

approaches. Network information is designed to assist mobile users in their decisions: mobiles make their selection decision based on their individual needs and preferences as well as on the cost and partial QoS parameters signaled by the network. To maximize user experience, we present a satisfaction-based Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) method. In comparison with existing MCDM methods, namely Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) [10], Multiplicative Exponent Weighting (MEW) [10], Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) [11] and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) [12], our algorithm meets the exact needs of mobile users (e.g., trafÔ¨Åc class, throughput demand, cost tolerance), thus avoiding oversized and undersized alternatives.
A particular attention is then addressed to the network to make sure it broadcasts appropriate decisional information, so as to enhance resource utilization while individual users are maximizing their own utility. We therefore introduce the slope tuning policy to dynamically derive what to signal to mobiles.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II describes our hybrid decision framework. Our satisfactionbased decision-making method is presented in section III. Section IV introduces our tuning policy. Simulation parameters and results are discussed in section V. Section VI concludes the document.

II. HYBRID DECISION FRAMEWORK
A. Network topology
Consider a heterogeneous wireless network composed of NT radio access technologies. The user-perceived signal-tonoise ratio (SN Rx, x = 1, ..., NT ) determines the user modulation and coding scheme, and subsequently its instantaneous peak rate (i.e., its perceived throughput when connected alone to RAT x). Since practically the set of achievable instantaneous peak rates is not continuous, RAT x cell is logically divided into NZx concentric rings (Fig. 1). Users in ring Zkx, k = 1, ..., NZx, with SN Rx between Œ¥kx and Œ¥kx‚àí1, have a peak rate of Dkx when connected to RAT x. The user peak rate in RAT x, namely Dx, is then expressed as a function of the user-perceived SNR as follows:

B. Network resources
In RAT x, the radio resource is divided into elementary resource units (RU). Typically, in OFDM(A)-based technologies (e.g., LTE and WiMAX technologies), resource units are deÔ¨Åned as OFDM symbols (one-dimensional allocations) or OFDMA slots (two-dimensional allocations: m subchannels by n OFDMA symbols). However, in CDMA-based technologies (e.g., HSPA technology), codes, power and allocation time are treated as RUs.
C. Network information
Network information is periodically sent to all mobile users using the logical communication channel (i.e., radio enabler) proposed by the IEEE standard 1900.4 [13]. In our work, this information is assumed to implicitly integrate operator objectives, guiding users decision. It may be static or variable so as to dynamically optimize short- or long-term network performance.
When a new or a handover session arrives, the mobile decodes the decisional information, evaluates available alternatives, and selects the technology that best suits it.
In this setting, we assume that the network information provides cost and some QoS parameters: they can be seen as incentives to join available alternatives.
‚Ä¢ Cost parameters: Because Ô¨Çat-rate pricing strategies waste resources, result in network congestion and thus degrade network performance [14], they are not optimal in supporting QoS. A volume-based model is therefore proposed: mobile users are charged based on the amount of trafÔ¨Åc they consume; in our work, costs are deÔ¨Åned on a per kbyte basis.
‚Ä¢ QoS parameters: The number of resource units (RUs) that need to be allocated to future arrivals are broadcasted: ‚Äì Mobiles are guaranteed an average minimum number of RUs, denoted by nmin. ‚Äì They also have priority to occupy up to an average maximum number of RUs, denoted by nmax. The network load conditions and capacity are, however, masked. In fact, nmin and nmax reveal the operator intention to serve future arrivals: they do not exclusively reÔ¨Çect the load conditions, but also other potential operator objectives. Since the smallest allocation unit (i.e., RU) may be different from one technology to another, there is a need

to homogenize the QoS information. QoS parameters are
then expressed as throughputs: dmin and dmax instead of nmin and nmax. Yet, because perceived throughputs highly depend on radio conditions (or equivalently on
adopted modulation types and FEC coding rates), dmin and dmax are derived for the most robust modulation and coding scheme (i.e., as perceived by users in ring ZNZ ). Consequently, when evaluating available alternatives, mo-
biles should combine their individual radio conditions
with the provided QoS parameters: for that they multiply
dmin and dmax with a given modulation and coding gain, denoted by g(M, C).

D. RAT selection
For each incoming session, the network proposes one or more alternatives, which are the available access technologies. For each alternative (a), the network broadcasts the three parameters: dmin(a), dmax(a), and cost(a). From the user point of view, these parameters are the decision criteria that will be used to evaluate the different access technologies. As in all multi-criteria decision making methods, the mobile has to deÔ¨Åne a utility function that will be computed for all of the available alternatives. This utility is obtained after normalizing and weighting the decision criteria.
The particularity of our RAT selection process resides in the normalization step that takes into account the trafÔ¨Åc class and throughput demand as detailed in the next section. Such approach overcomes some limitations of classical methods due to undersized and oversized decisions.

III. SATISFACTION-BASED DECISION METHOD

A. Normalization and TrafÔ¨Åc classes

As stated above, the normalization of decision criteria

dmin(a), dmax(a), and cost(a) depends on the session trafÔ¨Åc class and throughput demand. For trafÔ¨Åc class c and alternative

a, the normalization is a mapping cost(a) to dÀÜcmin(a), dÀÜcmax(a), and

coofsdtcm(ian)(are)s, pdemctaivxe(lay).,

and

In our work, we deÔ¨Åne two trafÔ¨Åc classes : streaming,

and elastic classes. Before we give the normalizing func-

tions for each trafÔ¨Åc class, let us note that pÀÜc(a), p ‚àà

{dmin, dmax, cost}, can be viewed as the satisfaction of a class c session with respect to criterion p for alternative a:

‚Ä¢ Streaming sessions (c = S): since designed to support real-time variable bit rate services (e.g., MPEG-4 video service), streaming sessions are fairly Ô¨Çexible and usually characterized by a minimum, an average and a maximum bandwidth requirement. Their throughput satisfaction is therefore modelled as an S-shaped function (Fig. 2(a)):

where d = {dmin, dmax}. Rav represents session needs: an average throughput demand. Œ± and Œ≤ are two positive constants to determine

the shape of the S-shaped function.

‚Ä¢ Elastic sessions (c = E): since designed to support traditional data services (e.g., Ô¨Åle transfer, email and web trafÔ¨Åc), elastic sessions adapt to resource availability (i.e., load conditions), requiring no QoS guarantees. Thus, dmin is completely ignored. Moreover, the satisfaction with respect to dmax has a concave shape (Fig. 2(b)): the satisfaction increases slowly as the throughput exceeds the comfort throughput demand Rc of the user (i.e., the mean throughput beyond which, user satisfaction exceeds 63% of maximum satisfaction).

‚Ä¢ For each alternative (a), the mobile combines its radio

‚Ä¢ Finally, it computes the utility function for each alterna-

tive (a) and selects the alternative with the highest score.

By broadcasting appropriate decisional information, the

network tries to globally control users decision in a way

to enhance resource utilization. On the other hand, mobiles

make their decisions so as to maximize their own satisfaction.

Selection decisions take then into account both user needs and

preferences and operator objectives. Network complexity and

processing load are, however, reduced.

IV. THE SLOPE TUNING POLICY
Because mobile users also rely on their needs and preferences to select their best alternative, the network does not

523

completely control individual decisions. However, by dynamically tuning its broadcasted information, the network tries to globally inÔ¨Çuence users decision in a way to enhance resource utilization.
When a RAT dominates all the others (i.e., provides higher QoS parameters for the same cost or the same QoS parameters for a lower cost), common radio resources are inefÔ¨Åciently utilized causing performance degradation. In fact, mobile users would select the dominant alternative, leading to unevenly distributed trafÔ¨Åc load. While a technology is overcrowded, the others are almost unexploited. This inefÔ¨Åciency is very similar to that of the user-centric approaches. To avoid it, QoS parameters, signaled by the network, needs to be modulated as a function of the load conditions.
Actually, as technologies are progressively loaded, QoS parameters (i.e., dmin and dmax) are gradually tuned. When the operator bandwidth guarantees ‚Äî identiÔ¨Åed as a generic load factor ‚Äî exceed a predeÔ¨Åned threshold S1, these parameters are linearly reduced down to zero, as shown in Fig. 5. The slope helps to well respond to trafÔ¨Åc load Ô¨Çuctuations.

In order to reduce network complexity and processing load (one of the drawbacks of the network-centric approaches), the proposed policy is basic and simple. Yet, it helps to efÔ¨Åciently distribute trafÔ¨Åc load over the available RATs and thus to better utilize radio resources.

V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
For illustration, we consider a heterogeneous wireless network composed of Mobile WiMAX and LTE radio access technologies. They are supposed to utilize a channel bandwidth of 5 and 10 MHz respectively. For economical and technical reasons, WiMAX base station and LTE Evolved Node B are assumed to be co-localized, having the same coverage. As a consequence, and since both technologies use OFDMA on the downlink, their cell may be divided into overlayed concentric rings.
For the sake of simplicity, users are of two types: users with good radio conditions adopting the 64-QAM: 3/4 (4.5 bits/symbol) and users with bad radio conditions adopting the 16-QAM: 1/2 (2 bits/symbol). Their peak rates (i.e., their perceived throughput when connected alone to WiMAX and LTE technologies) are reported in Table I.
We compare our hybrid approach with other networkcentric, hybrid and user-centric methods. To evaluate selection decisions, network and users utilities are introduced. The

TABLE I PEAK RATES IN MOBILE WIMAX AND LTE

network utility reÔ¨Çects operator objectives: it is deÔ¨Åned as the total offered throughput. However, the users utility reÔ¨Çects the average user-perceived satisfaction: it depends on their needs and preferences and thus take into account both QoS and cost considerations.
Radio resources are actually allocated using fair time scheduling. Yet, when our hybrid method is employed, mobiles are Ô¨Årst provided with their minimum guaranteed throughput given by dmin. Then, fair time scheduling is used to provide them with up to their maximum throughput given by dmax. The remaining resources may afterwards be equitably shared (i.e., after receiving their maximum throughput, all mobiles have the same priority leading to fair time scheduling).
Mobiles arrive in sequence and are uniformly ready either to pay for better performances, or to sacriÔ¨Åce within limits their service quality seeking to save up money. When users decision needs to be evaluated, or typically when their perceived satisfaction is to be computed, a set of cost tolerance parameter and QoS and cost weights is used according to user preferences (cf. Table II).

TABLE II COST TOLERANCE PARAMETER AND QOS AND COST WEIGHTS
For comparison purposes, six different RAT selection techniques are considered:
‚Ä¢ Peak rate maximization: Mobile users have no information on the global network state. Based on their radio conditions, they select the RAT that offers them the best peak rate.
‚Ä¢ Instantaneous rate maximization: Mobiles are assumed to know the exact numbers of users that are connected to available technologies. Assuming that fair time scheduling is employed, they select the RAT that offers them the best throughput. Their estimated throughput in RAT x, Dx, at the time of selection, is computed as:

Dx

=

Dx 1 + Nx

(5)

where Dx represents the user peak rate when connected

to RAT x and N x represents the number of users that are

connected to RAT x at the time of selection.

‚Ä¢ Satisfaction-based using peak rate (SB - PR): Using

their peak rates, mobiles adopt the Satisfaction-based

multi-criteria decision-making method to select their best

RAT. In order to evaluate the different technologies, the

provided QoS parameters in Eq. 2 and 3 are replaced with

the peak rate that mobiles can achieve when connected

to these technologies.

524

‚Ä¢ Satisfaction-based using instantaneous rate (SB IR): Mobiles use the Satisfaction-based multi-criteria decision-making method to select the RAT that maximizes their expected utility. In Eq. 2 and 3, the provided QoS parameters are replaced with the average throughput that mobiles estimate to obtain (cf. Eq. 5).
‚Ä¢ Exhaustive search: The network considers all possible associations involving all users. It Ô¨Ånally selects the combination that optimizes its own utility. Actually, it assigns mobiles to either WiMAX or LTE technologies in a way to maximize the total offered throughput. This is known to be the optimal method with respect to operator objectives: it leads to the highest network utility.
‚Ä¢ Our hybrid approach: The network periodically sends decisional information (i.e., cost and QoS parameters) to assist mobile users in their decisions. QoS parameters are signaled with the following thresholds: S1 = 0.3 and S2 = 0.8. Thereby, a network is considered to be low-loaded when its load factor is below 0.3. Initial dmin and dmax are then signaled (cf. Table III). Yet, when its load factor exceeds 0.8, a network is considered to be highly loaded, providing no QoS guarantees.

TABLE III INITIAL QOS AND COST PARAMETERS

When using the peak rate maximization and the SB PR methods, mobiles select their RAT without any network assistance. Decisions are then user-centric. However, when employing the instantaneous rate maximization and the SB - IR methods, load conditions signaled by the network assist mobile users in their decisions. The latter two methods are thus considered to be hybrid. Finally, when adopting the exhaustive search method, decisions are network-centric since they are made by the network transparently to end-users.
Since in practice telecom operators will not reveal neither the exact numbers of users that are connected to their RATs nor the scheduling algorithm they adopt, the instantaneous rate maximization and the SB - IR methods are not realistic. Yet, they serve to illustrate the gain from masking network load conditions and only signaling cost and some QoS parameters in order to enhance resource utilization.

A. Streaming sessions
We assume that streaming sessions have an average longterm throughput of 1 Mb/s. So as to improve content quality, they can furthermore beneÔ¨Åt from throughputs up to 1.5 Mb/s (i.e., Rav = 1 Mb/s and Rmax = 1.5 Mb/s).
When our proposed hybrid approach is used, the cost tolerance parameter and the weights that are assigned to the decision criteria (i.e., dmin, dmax and cost) are put forward in Table IV. When proÔ¨Åle no. 1 is assigned to users that are ready to pay for better performances, proÔ¨Åle no. 2 is attributed to those that seek to save up money.

Fig. 7. User utility: Streaming sessions scenario
When the SB - PR method is used, all users select the mobile WiMAX technology (i.e., Mobile WiMAX is their best trade-off between cost and QoS decision criteria). Regardless of user preferences and radio conditions, mobile WiMAX is expected to provide mobile users with the highest utility. Since mobiles use their peak rate in estimating their utility, their decisions do not depend on network load conditions. As a result, mobiles continue to select the WiMAX technology even when it gets overloaded.
At low trafÔ¨Åc load, mobile WiMAX can meet users QoS needs, while charging them less. When users beneÔ¨Åt from

525

throughputs up to their Rmax and pay less, they have the highest utility (i.e., satisfaction). However, when WiMAX gets loaded, it becomes no longer able to fulÔ¨Åll users QoS needs. Typically, at medium and high trafÔ¨Åc load, WiMAX becomes saturated leading to a signiÔ¨Åcant decrease of the user-perceived throughput below Rav (cf. Fig. 6). As a consequence, userperceived satisfaction will also dramatically decrease (cf. Fig. 7).
Furthermore, when the peak rate maximization method is adopted, all users select the LTE technology. Actually, independently of their modulation and coding scheme, mobiles can achieve the best peak rate when connected to the LTE technology. Here again, their decisions do not change with network load conditions. As a consequence, at high trafÔ¨Åc load, user-perceived throughput goes below Rmax. Yet, it continues to be greater than Rav.
On the other hand, since LTE charges more than WiMAX does, mobile users experience the lowest satisfaction level at low trafÔ¨Åc load. As a matter of fact, when all RAT selection techniques meet users QoS needs, the peak rate maximization method assign all users to the LTE technology, thus charging them more. At high trafÔ¨Åc load, because userperceived throughput decreases, their experienced utility also diminishes.
Moreover, when the SB - IR method is employed, users combine their needs and preferences with network load conditions to select their best RAT. As a consequence, at low trafÔ¨Åc load and regardless of their radio conditions, all users select the mobile WiMAX technology: their QoS needs are perfeclty met while paying less. This leads to the highest user-perceived utility, as in the case of the SB - PR method. However, when the mobile WiMAX gets loaded, users may start to join the LTE technology according to their radio conditions and preferences (i.e., their willingness to pay for better performances). Precisely, based on their modulation and coding scheme, as well as on their cost tolerance parameter and QoS and cost weights (cf. Table II), users estimate the utility they can obtain in both of the available RATs. They then select the technology with the highest expected utility. In fact, users with bad radio conditions that are ready to pay for better performances are the Ô¨Årst to start to join the LTE technology. Besides, users with good radio conditions that seek to save up money are the last to start to join the LTE technology.
Consequently, since users are not proportionally distributed over the two RATs, mobile WiMAX gets overloaded before the LTE. Thus, the growth rate of the network utility decreases as the total throughput demand increases (cf. Fig. 6). This means that the average user-perceived throughput decreases. Yet, it remains greater than Rav. When some users start to join LTE and so pay more, and others that are connected to WiMAX start to perceive lower throughputs, the average user satisfaction also decreases as the total throughput demand increases (cf. Fig. 7).
Furthermore, our hybrid approach and the instantaneous rate maximization method perfectly meet users QoS needs, even at high trafÔ¨Åc load. Their network utility, as depicted in Fig. 6,

is so close to that of the exhaustive search method, known to be the optimal one with respect to resource utilization. Yet, as shown in Fig. 7, our hybrid approach provides the highest user utility.
In fact, when the instantaneous rate maximization method is used, mobiles select the RAT that offers them the best throughput. Therefore, a kind of load balancing is achieved: Mobile WiMAX and LTE are similarly occupied with respect to their maximum capacity. As a result, the network utility can likely follow the throughput demand increase. On the other hand, when our hybrid approach is employed, the network modulates the broadcasted QoS parameters as a function of its load conditions. It tries to push future arrivals to less loaded RATs, thus enhancing resource utilization. By integrating their needs and preferences, mobiles can avoid oversized decisions and so improve their perceived-satisfaction. Typically, at low trafÔ¨Åc load, when both RATs can perfectly meet users QoS needs, mobile WiMAX will be preferred since it charges less. This explains why, when using our hybrid method, user utility is constantly higher than when adopting the instantaneous rate maximization method. The latter ignores user preferences (i.e., its willingness to pay for better performances or to save up money) and mainly deals with load balancing. However, because the proportion of users that are connected to the LTE technology is almost constant and the user-perceived throughput is always close to Rmax, user utility hardly changes as a function of the total throughput demand. On the other side, when using our hybrid method, since the proportion of users that are connected to the LTE increases with the total throughput demand, the average user utility decreases since LTE charges more than WiMAX. Yet, it always remains greater than that of the instantaneous rate maximization method.
Moreover, when using the exhaustive search method, the network involves all users at each decision epoch: it considers all possible combinations and selects the one that maximizes its own utility. Since user needs and preferences are ignored, and RATs are not statistically similarly occupied, this network-centric method provides the lowest user utility amongst the instantaneous rate maximization method and our hybrid approach. As a matter of fact, the network seeks to optimize its own utility, regardless of user preferences. In other words, when different combinations lead to the same network utility, they are assumed equivalent. The one that better distributes mobiles over the two RATs has no priority. As a result, statistically, the proportion of users that are connected to the LTE is higher than those of the instantaneous rate maximization and our hybrid methods, leading to lower user-perceived satisfaction (cf. Fig. 7).
To conclude, so as to illustrate the gain from masking network load conditions and only signaling cost and some QoS parameters, we compare our hybrid approach with the SB - IR one. Actually, when using our hybrid method, we can push users to LTE long before WiMAX really gets overloaded. By reducing the broadcasted QoS parameters in WiMAX, typically with S1 = 0.3 and S2 = 0.8, future arrivals are encouraged to join LTE well in advance in comparison with

526

the SB - IR scenario. Thereby, sessions are better distributed over the two RATs, leading to higher network utility as shown in Fig. 6.
At low trafÔ¨Åc load, both methods perfectly meet users QoS needs. Yet, since the proportion of users that are connected to the most expensive RAT (i.e., LTE) is higher when our hybrid approach is used, user-perceived satisfaction is lower than that of the SB - IR method. However, at high throughput demand, because future arrivals start to join LTE much earlier than the SB - IR case, WiMAX is on average less loaded when using our hybrid approach. As a consequence, WiMAX can better serve its on-going sessions leading to higher user-perceived throughput. Therefore, although mobiles may pay more (i.e., the proportion of users that are connected to LTE is higher), they experience signiÔ¨Åcantly better performances leading to higher satisfaction (Fig. 7). After all, by dynamically tuning QoS parameters, the network enhances resource utilization while mobiles maximize their satisfaction.
B. Elastic sessions
Elastic sessions adapt to resource availability. Their needs are expressed as comfort throughput, denoted by Rc. We assume in the following that Rc is related to the user willingness to pay and thus imposed by the user proÔ¨Åle (cf. Table V). Typically, when users are ready to pay for better performances, they have a comfort throughput of 1.25 Mb/s. Yet, when they seek to save up money, they are content with a comfort throughput of 0.75 Mb/s.

sessions are present, they all share these resources. As a result, the network utility, deÔ¨Åned as the total offered throughput, do not usually change as a function of the total number of users Ntotal (cf. Fig 8). Yet, the average user-perceived throughput is reduced.
As in the case of streaming sessions, when the SB PR method is used, all users are connected to the mobile WiMAX technology regardless of the network load conditions. As shown in Fig. 8, the total offered throughput (i.e., the network utility) is close to 12 Mb/s independently of Ntotal: it actually corresponds to the weighted average total throughput taking into account both users with good and bad radio conditions. However, the average user-perceived throughput linearly decreases with Ntotal, leading to a signiÔ¨Åcant decrease of the user-perceived satisfaction (cf. Fig. 9).
Moreover, when the peak rate maximization method is adopted, all users select the LTE technology. The network utility is then, on average, higher than that of the SB - PR method. As a consequence, user-perceived throughput is also higher. But, since all users are connected to the most expensive RAT (i.e., LTE), the satisfaction improvement with respect to the perceived throughput criterion fails to offset the satisfaction decrease with respect to the cost criterion. This leads to a lower user-perceived satisfaction in comparison with the SB PR case (cf. Fig. 9).
Furthermore, when the exhaustive search method is employed, optimal resource utilization is achieved as shown in Fig. 8. Yet, the average user utility is not that interesting. First, when assigning mobiles to the available RATs, this networkcentric method do not consider user preferences. It actually ignores user willingness to pay for better performances or to save up money, and only seeks to maximize the network offered throughput. Second, in order to better exploit the available resources, only few users with good radio conditions may be assigned to LTE. The majority, with bad and also good radio conditions, will be connected to mobile WiMAX, all competing for the same resources. As a result, few users connected to LTE will have excellent throughputs that far outweigh their Rc. The others will experience relatively low throughputs that may be well below their Rc. This asso-

ciation optimizes the total offered throughput, but not the user-perceived satisfaction (cf. Fig. 9). Actually, because of its concave form, even the satisfaction with respect to the throughput criterion is not maximized.
In comparison with the exhaustive search method, mobiles are better distributed over the two RATs when the instantaneous rate maximization method is adopted. In fact, users select the RAT that offers them the best throughput, leading to a kind of load balancing as in the streaming case. As a result, mobiles with equivalent radio conditions will have close throughputs regardless of their access technology. Since even users with bad radio conditions may be connected to LTE, the network utility is on average lower than that of the exhaustive search method known to be the optimal one. However, because on average perceived throughputs better meet user needs (i.e., their Rc), the user utility is signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than that of the exhaustive search approach.
On the other hand, when the SB - IR method is used, mobile users combine their needs and preferences with the network load conditions so as to select their best RAT. At low trafÔ¨Åc load (typically for Ntotal = 5), more users select the mobile WiMAX technology in comparison with the instantaneous rate maximization method. When WiMAX can meet user needs very well, it charges them less. Occasionally, based on the current load conditions, a user with bad radio conditions, that is ready to pay for better performances, would select the LTE technology. As Ntotal increases, more users including those with good radio conditions start to join LTE, leading to higher network utility. The latter remain almost constant at medium and high load conditions. On average, it is slightly lower than that of the instantaneous rate maximization method. Yet, since selection decisions take into account user needs and preferences, typically their cost considerations, the user utility is signiÔ¨Åcantly better than that of the instantaneous rate maximization method.
Lastly, by masking network load conditions and only signaling some cost and QoS parameters, our hybrid approach drives users decision in a way to enhance resource utilization. At low trafÔ¨Åc load, more users typically those with bad radio conditions, that are ready to pay, select LTE. This leads to a higher network utility in comparison with the SB - IR method where, as explained before, users may occasionally join LTE (cf. Fig. 8). As a result, and although users pay on average more, they experience higher satisfaction since they have quite better throughput.
As Ntotal increases, QoS parameters are reduced with S1 = 0.3 and S2 = 0.8. As a consequence, future arrivals are encouraged to join LTE much earlier than the SB - IR case. However, users with good radio conditions that seek to save up money are the last to start to join LTE. In comparison with the SB - IR method, most users that are connected to WiMAX have good radio conditions, and more users with good and bad radio conditions are connected to LTE. This leads to higher total offered throughput, as shown in Fig. 8. Yet, the user utility is so close to that of the SB - IR scenario, since users having better performances pay on average more.

VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we address the access technology selection in heterogeneous wireless networks and proposes a hybrid decision method. Cost and QoS parameters, periodically signaled by the network, assists mobile users in their decisions. Our proposed solution combines beneÔ¨Åts from both networkcentric and user-centric approaches: it considers operator objectives as well as user needs and preferences, without unduly complicating the network. In comparison with different RAT selection techniques, including network-centric, hybrid and user-centric approaches, simulation results prove the efÔ¨Åciency of our hybrid method in enhancing resource utilization and maximizing user satisfaction. In the streaming sessions scenario, it optimizes the total offered throughput and maximizes the average user utility (except at low trafÔ¨Åc load, where the non-realistic SB - IR method provides higher user satisfaction). Also, in the elastic sessions scenario, our hybrid approach signiÔ¨Åcantly enhances resource utilization and maximizes user utilities in comparison with various user-centric and hybrid methods. Furthermore, compared with the exhaustive search method, known to be the optimal one with respect to resource utilization, our hybrid approach provides signiÔ¨Åcantly higher user satisfaction.
