Abstract‚ÄîIn this study, we investigate the problem of partially overlapping channel assignment to improve the performance of 802.11 wireless networks. We Ô¨Årst derive a novel interference model that takes into account both the adjacent channel separation and the physical distance of the two nodes employing adjacent channels. This model deÔ¨Ånes ‚Äúnode orthogonality‚Äù, which states that two nodes over adjacent channels are orthogonal if they are physically sufÔ¨Åciently separated. We propose an approximate algorithm MICA to minimize the total interference for throughput maximization. Extensive simulation study has been performed to validate our design and to compare the performances of our algorithm with those of the state-of-the-art.
I. INTRODUCTION
The increasing popularity of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) has led to a dramatic increase in the density of Access Points (APs) in many real-world applications. High node density results in strong interference and poor network performance [1]. Thus, multichannel communications has been proposed as a viable approach to mitigate such problems [2].
Nevertheless, mainstream research focuses on assigning non-overlapping channels to interfering nodes [2]‚Äì[5]. Under such a consideration, two interfering nodes can simultaneously transmit without interfering with each other only if their channels are orthogonal. However, because the number of nonoverlapping channels is very limited (802.11b/g deÔ¨Ånes only 3 orthogonal channels), interference can not be completely eliminated in practical settings.
Recent studies indicate that utilizing partially overlapping channels to facilitate interference mitigation can improve the full-range channel utilization and the network throughput [6]‚Äì [8]. These advantages are attributed to the fact that partially overlapping channels do not cause interference with each other if the two nodes (i.e., the transmitter of one channel, and the receiver of the other adjacent channel) are sufÔ¨Åciently physically separated. Unfortunately, this property is not fully investigated as it should be. The interference models in [6], [7] only consider the channel separation. Though Ding et al. [8] present a weighted conÔ¨Çict graph by taking into account both the channel separation and the physical distance, its interference indicator is a 0-1 variable that cannot accurately reÔ¨Çect

the degree of interference from different adjacent channels with different physical distances.
In this paper, we investigate channel allocation by considering all channels equally. We Ô¨Årst propose a novel Interference Factor Ì†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±ê that captures the degree of interference between two channels at different positions. This interference factor is employed to formulate an interference minimization problem for partially overlapping channel assignment to maximize the aggregated network throughput. Also, an approximate algorithms, MICA, to tackle the optimization problem via relaxation and rounding, is proposed. MICA, which stands for Minimum Interference for Channel Allocation, minimizes the sum of the weighted interference.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The network and interference models are described in Section II. In Section III, we investigate the problem of interference minimization and throughput maximization. Our algorithm is proposed with details in Section IV. After reporting our performance evaluation in Section V, we conclude this paper in Section VI.
II. NETWORK AND INTERFERENCE MODELS
A. Network Model
In this paper, we consider an IEEE 802.11-based WLAN in which a user associates to the AP with the highest Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI). An AP together with its associated users form a Basic Service Set (BSS). All nodes belonging to the same BSS operate on the same channel, i.e., the AP‚Äôs channel. Since APs in close neighborhood may be assigned partially overlapping channels, BSSs might interfere with each other.
The objective of this study is to investigate adjacent channel assignment for downlink network performance maximization. Note that we choose to focus on downlink, in which data is sent by APs to users, because it carries the dominate trafÔ¨Åc for many real-world applications such as in social networks [1], [4]. Adjacent channel assignment to maximize uplink performance will be investigated in our future research. For downlink, the experienced interference of an AP depends on the received power from other APs. There are three main factors that affect the received power from an interfering AP:

978-1-4244-9921-2/11/$26.00 ¬©2011 IEEE

361

(i) the transmit power of the interfering AP, (ii) the channel

separation, and (iii) the physical distance between the two APs.

For simplicity, we assume that all APs transmit at the same

power Ì†µÌ±ù. But the proposed interference model and algorithms

can be easily extended to the case when the transmit powers

vary.

The IEEE 802.11 standard deÔ¨Ånes a set of discrete channels

for radios to operate on. The transmitter should follow the

Transmit Spectrum Mask deÔ¨Åned in the standard when allo-

cating a power to each frequency in the channel band, with

the center frequency of the channel band receiving the highest

power. At the receiver side, a band-pass Ô¨Ålter, again deÔ¨Åned

by the standard, is employed to capture the transmitted power.

To characterize their relationship, we introduce the concept of

channel adjacency degree, which is deÔ¨Åned as the amount of

transmit power covered by the receiver band-pass Ô¨Ålter [7]:

‚àí‚àû

where Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ñ and Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ó are the transmit and receive channel numbers, respectively, Ì†µÌ±ÜÌ†µÌ±°(Ì†µÌ±ì ) is the transmit power distribution across the frequency spectrum, Ì†µÌ±ÜÌ†µÌ±ü(Ì†µÌ±ì ) is the band-pass Ô¨Ålter‚Äôs frequency response, and Ì†µÌºè is the channel separation in MHz.

B. Interference Model

Since Ì†µÌºô(Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ñ, Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ó) only considers the channel separation, it is not the right parameter to characterize interference. To
introduce our interference model for partially overlapping channels, we start from a simple case that consists of AP Ì†µÌ±ñ transmitting at channel Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ñ and AP Ì†µÌ±ó receiving at channel Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ó. Let Ì†µÌ±Å0 be the noise experienced by AP Ì†µÌ±ó, and Ì†µÌªæÌ†µÌ±°‚Ñé be the SINR threshold for successful communications. Then, to correctly
decode a signal, the following condition must be held:

Ì†µÌªæÌ†µÌ±°‚Ñé

<

Ì†µÌºô(Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ñ,

Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ó )Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ë‚àíÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±óÌ†µÌªº Ì†µÌ±Å0

,

(1)

where Ì†µÌ±ù is the transmit power, Ì†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó is the physical distance between AP Ì†µÌ±ñ and AP Ì†µÌ±ó, and Ì†µÌªº is the shadowing factor ranging

from 2.0 to 5.0 [9]. Note that this inequality indicates that a

transmission made on a channel Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ñ can be correctly received

at a partially overlapping channel Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ó as long as the received

signal is strong enough. Based on this observation, we deÔ¨Åne

the adjacent channel transmission range between Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ñ and Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ó,

denoted by Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±°(Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ñ, Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ó), as follows: ‚àö

Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±°(Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ñ, Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ó ) = Ì†µÌªº

al. [8] conduct an experimental study to obtain the settings of Ì†µÌªΩ(Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ñ, Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ó), for different channel separations under different AP transmission bit rates in 802.11b networks.
Now, we are ready to deÔ¨Åne our interference factor, which
takes both the physical distance separation and the channel separation into account. For two APs Ì†µÌ±ñ and Ì†µÌ±ó separated by a physical distance of Ì†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó, the normalized interference factor between Ì†µÌ±ñ and Ì†µÌ±ó, denoted by Ì†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±ê(Ì†µÌ±ñ, Ì†µÌ±ó), is mapped to a real number in [0, 1] and deÔ¨Åned by Eq. (3):

Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ó )} .

(3)

Especially, we deÔ¨Åne that Ì†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±ê(Ì†µÌ±ñ, Ì†µÌ±ó) = 0, if Ì†µÌ∞∑Ì†µÌ±ñ(Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ñ, Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ó) = 0. From Eq. (3), it can be observed that Ì†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±ê(Ì†µÌ±ñ, Ì†µÌ±ó) has the following properties: (i) For a Ô¨Åxed physical distance Ì†µÌ±ëÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó, Ì†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±ê(Ì†µÌ±ñ, Ì†µÌ±ó) monotonically decreases with the channel separation. (ii) For a Ô¨Åxed channel separation, Ì†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±ê(Ì†µÌ±ñ, Ì†µÌ±ó) monotonically decreases with the physical distance. (iii) Ì†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±ê(Ì†µÌ±ñ, Ì†µÌ±ó) is a real number in [0, 1]. A larger value indicates more serious interference. When Ì†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±ê(Ì†µÌ±ñ, Ì†µÌ±ó) = 0, AP Ì†µÌ±ñ and Ì†µÌ±ó can transmit simultaneously without interfering with each other. Note that properties (i) and (ii) of Ì†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±ê(Ì†µÌ±ñ, Ì†µÌ±ó) are consistent with the observations obtained from realworld experiments [7], [10]. In other words, we use Ì†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±ê(Ì†µÌ±ñ, Ì†µÌ±ó) to summarize the observations in [7], [10] mathematically. The
property (iii) describes the degree of interference of different node pairs. Ì†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±ê(Ì†µÌ±ñ, Ì†µÌ±ó) is unitless, and is normalized to the range [0, 1]. Therefore it can be used to compare the interference
degree of different node pairs, no matter which channels the
transmitter and receiver are using. Also note that Ì†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±ê(Ì†µÌ±ñ, Ì†µÌ±ó) can be used to deÔ¨Åne ‚Äúnode orthogo-
nality‚Äù. Traditionally, orthogonality refers to the independency
among channels where two channels are orthogonal if and only if they are non-overlapping. With Ì†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±ê(Ì†µÌ±ñ, Ì†µÌ±ó), the deÔ¨Ånition of orthogonality can be extended to nodes: two nodes are orthogonal if and only if their Ì†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±ê(Ì†µÌ±ñ, Ì†µÌ±ó) is equal to 0. Indeed, the focus of this paper is to investigate the node orthogonality
for channel assignment to decrease interference and improve
performance.

III. THROUGHPUT MAXIMIZATION WITH PARTIALLY OVERLAPPING CHANNELS

A. Problem Formulation

Consider the BSS of AP Ì†µÌ±ó operating on channel Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ó. The bit rate of a user is determined by its experienced SINR. Let Ì†µÌªæÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó denote the SINR of user Ì†µÌ±ñ associated with AP Ì†µÌ±ó over Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ó. In
the partially overlapping channel scenario, we have:

Ì†µÌªæÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó =

‚àëÌ†µÌ±Å

Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ë‚àíÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±óÌ†µÌªº Ì†µÌºô(Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ò, Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ó )Ì†µÌ±ùÌ†µÌ±ë‚àíÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±òÌ†µÌªº

+

, Ì†µÌ±Å0

(4)

Ì†µÌ±ò=1

where the denominator captures the interference experienced
by user Ì†µÌ±ñ caused by APs working at channel Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ò. The corresponding bit rate Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó can be calculated based on Shannon‚Äôs capacity theory: Ì†µÌ±üÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó = Ì†µÌ∞µ log2(1+Ì†µÌªæÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó), where Ì†µÌ∞µ is the channel bandwidth.

362

Let Ì†µÌ±èÌ†µÌ±ñ(Ì†µÌ±ñ = 1, 2, . . . , Ì†µÌ±Ä ), be the effective bandwidth of user Ì†µÌ±ñ. The bandwidth of user Ì†µÌ±ñ obtained from AP Ì†µÌ±ó is denoted by Ì†µÌ±èÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó. Let Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó be the binary association coefÔ¨Åcient of user Ì†µÌ±ñ and AP Ì†µÌ±ó with Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó = 1 if and only if the user Ì†µÌ±ñ is associated with AP Ì†µÌ±ó. Note that Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó is a constant since a user selects the AP with the strongest RSSI from all its available APs. Therefore,
the user bandwidth is determined by

‚àë Ì†µÌ±Å

Ì†µÌ±èÌ†µÌ±ñ = Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó Ì†µÌ±èÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó .

Ì†µÌ±ó=1

For a given user-AP association {Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó}, our goal is to max-

imize the aggregated throughput in the network by allocating

Ì†µÌ±èÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó =

Ì†µÌ±ò‚ààÌ†µÌ±àÌ†µÌ±† (Ì†µÌ±ó )

(6)

0, otherwise,

with Ì†µÌ±àÌ†µÌ±†(Ì†µÌ±ó) being a user set consisting of all users associated with AP Ì†µÌ±ó. Note that Eq. (6) indicates that to obtain the maxi-

mum aggregated throughput, only the user with the highest bit

rate is allowed to communicate in the multi-rate environment.

For this optimization problem we need to consider the

following two constraints: (i) Each AP is allowed to access
only one channel. Let Ì†µÌ±åÌ†µÌ±Å√óÌ†µÌ∞æ = {Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ó‚Ñé} be a binary matrix indicating the channel assignment, where Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ó‚Ñé = 1 if and only if AP Ì†µÌ±ó transmits over channel ‚Ñé(‚Ñé = Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ó). With this notation, Ì†µÌ±èÌ†µÌ±ñ can be expressed by Ì†µÌ±èÌ†µÌ±ñ(Ì†µÌ±å ). (ii) The SINR at user Ì†µÌ±ñ must be at least Ì†µÌªæÌ†µÌ±°‚Ñé > 0, i.e., Ì†µÌªæÌ†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó ‚â• Ì†µÌªæÌ†µÌ±°‚Ñé for Ì†µÌ±ó = 1, 2, ‚ãÖ ‚ãÖ ‚ãÖ , Ì†µÌ±Å .
In summary, mathematically the partially overlapping chan-

nel allocation for throughput maximization can be formulated by the following optimization problem, with Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ó‚Ñé as the set of variables to be determined:

‚àë Ì†µÌ±Ä

For simplicity, the above optimization program is referred as the Original Channel Allocation Problem (O-CAP). Eq. (7a) is our objective function with each Ì†µÌ±èÌ†µÌ±ñ calculated by Eq. (5). The constraint (7b) shows that an AP is allowed to access only one
channel; the constraint (7c) indicates that the SINR between user Ì†µÌ±ñ and AP Ì†µÌ±ó must meet the communication requirement; and the constraint (7d) speciÔ¨Åes the range of the variable Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ó‚Ñé.

B. Throughput vs. Interference

In this subsection, we study the relationship between throughput and interference when partially overlapping channels are employed. Given a channel assignment, we can

construct a weighted interference graph Ì†µÌ∞∫(Ì†µÌ±â, Ì†µÌ∞∏) such that

each AP corresponds to a node in Ì†µÌ±â and an edge with a weight

Ì†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±ê(Ì†µÌ±ñ, Ì†µÌ±ó) between two nodes Ì†µÌ±ñ and Ì†µÌ±ó exists if and only if Ì†µÌ±ñ, Ì†µÌ±ó ‚àà Ì†µÌ±â

and Ì†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±ê(Ì†µÌ±ñ, Ì†µÌ±ó) > 0. An example is shown in Fig. 1(a), in which

four APs {Ì†µÌ±é, Ì†µÌ±è, Ì†µÌ±ê, Ì†µÌ±ë} and four users {Ì†µÌ±¢1, Ì†µÌ±¢2, Ì†µÌ±¢3, Ì†µÌ±¢4} form an

Based on the weighted interference graph, we construct the following optimization problem (Eq. (8)) to minimize the sum of the weighted interference, which is referred as Min-Ic. Note that Min-Ic is simpler compared to O-CAP as the minimum SINR requirements of the users are removed.

From Eqs. (2) and (3), it can be observed that maximizing

Eq. (7a) is equivalent to minimizing Eq. (8a). In other words, for a given user-AP association {Ì†µÌ±•Ì†µÌ±ñÌ†µÌ±ó}, O-CAP and Min-Ic are equivalent. Thus, we can solve a relatively simpler problem,

i.e., Min-Ic in stead of the more complex O-CAP to compute

the channel assignment for throughput optimization.

The example illustrated in Fig. 1 is used to validate the

relationship between the aggregated throughput and the sum

of the weighted interference. Since each AP has only one user,

the aggregated throughput is the sum of the bit rates of all

users. There are six available partially overlapping channels,

with only two non-overlapping ones, i.e., 1 and 6. The optimal

channel assignment by Min-Ic and the corresponding total

throughput and total interference are reported in the Ô¨Årst row

of Table I. For comparison purpose, we also provide the

363

throughput and total interference of other feasible channel assignment solutions.

IV. APPROXIMATE ALGORITHM FOR MIN-IC
In this section, we propose a centralized approximate algorithm termed Minimum Interference for Channel Allocation (MICA), for the problem Min-Ic. MICA is executed by placing a network manager to collect the necessary information based on which to calculate the channel assignment. It consists of three steps as shown in Alg. 1.
Algorithm 1 MICA 1: Obtain the fractional solution {Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ†µÌ±óÌ±ì‚Ñé} by solving a relaxed optimization. 2: Obtain the integral solution {Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ó‚Ñé} by a rounding process. 3: Assign the channels to APs

The basic idea is to relax the 0-1 binary variable Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ó‚Ñé such that a fractional optimal solution can be found in polynomial time. Then we use a rounding process to obtain an integral solution based on which we assign adjacent channels to all APs. The details are elaborated in the following two subsections.

A. Relaxation of Min-Ic

The Ô¨Årst step is to relax the binary variable Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ó‚Ñé such that 0 ‚â§ Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ó‚Ñé ‚â§ 1. That is, an AP is allowed to access multiple channels. In such a scenario, AP Ì†µÌ±ó selects channel ‚Ñé if Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ó‚Ñé > 0. Let Ì†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ†µÌ±êÌ±ì (Ì†µÌ±ò, Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ò, Ì†µÌ±ó, Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ó) be the interference between AP Ì†µÌ±ò in channel Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ò and AP Ì†µÌ±ó in channel Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ó(Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ó = ‚Ñé). Thus, the total interference between AP Ì†µÌ±ò and Ì†µÌ±ó is:

Substituting the Ì†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±ê(Ì†µÌ±ò, Ì†µÌ±ó) in Eq. (8) with that in Eq. (9), we

obtain the corresponding relaxed optimization problem that is

This problem can be solved in polynomial time. The frac-
tional optimal solution to the problem RMin-Ic is denoted by Ì†µÌ∞º(Ì†µÌ±å Ì†µÌ±ì ).

B. Rounding for Min-Ic

In this step, we use the rounding algorithm proposed in [11]

to obtain an integral assignment matrix Ì†µÌ±å . The main idea is

to construct a weighted bipartite graph based on the fractional

assignment and Ô¨Ånd the minimum-weight matching for the

problem Min-Ic. First, we introduce a deÔ¨Ånition to be used in

the rounding process.

Ì†µÌ±ò=1 Ì†µÌ±êÌ†µÌ±ò=1

The detail of the rounding scheme is as follows. First,

we construct a bipartite graph Ì†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ∞µ(Ì†µÌ±å ) = (Ì†µÌ∞¥, Ì†µÌ±â, Ì†µÌ∞∏), where the set Ì†µÌ∞¥ represents the APs in the network, and the set

Ì†µÌ±â consists 1, . . . , Ì†µÌ∞æ, Ì†µÌ±†

of =

‚Ñé= This

means that each channel may have multiple nodes in Ì†µÌ±â . The

edges in Ì†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ∞µ(Ì†µÌ±å ) are constructed in the following way. For each channel ‚Ñé, we renumber the APs according to their

non-increasing experienced interference Ì†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±ó‚Ñé(Ì†µÌ±é). If Ì†µÌ±Ü‚Ñé ‚â§ 1,

for each Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ†µÌ±óÌ±ì‚Ñé > 0, add an edge Ì†µÌ±í(Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±ó, Ì†µÌ±£‚Ñé1) to Ì†µÌ∞∏, and set

a case, the weight of each edge Ì†µÌ±í(Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±ó, Ì†µÌ±£‚ÑéÌ†µÌ±†) in Ì†µÌ∞∏ is deÔ¨Åned by

Ì†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±ó‚Ñé(Ì†µÌ±é).

Second, we Ô¨Ånd a minimum-weight matching Ì†µÌ±Ä (Ì†µÌ±å ) that

matches each AP node to a channel node in Ì†µÌ∞∫Ì†µÌ∞µ(Ì†µÌ±å ). For each edge Ì†µÌ±í(Ì†µÌ±éÌ†µÌ±ó, Ì†µÌ±£‚ÑéÌ†µÌ±†) in Ì†µÌ±Ä (Ì†µÌ±å ), schedule AP Ì†µÌ±ó on channel ‚Ñé and set Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ó‚Ñé = 1. Set other Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±óÌ†µÌ±†‚Äôs to be 0. Since the fractional assignment {Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ†µÌ±óÌ±ì‚Ñé} speciÔ¨Åes a fractional matching, such a maximal matching does exist and it determines the

integral association {Ì†µÌ±¶Ì†µÌ±ó‚Ñé}. Note that the rounding procedure of Algorithm 1 also

completes the third step, i.e., assigning channels to the APs

based on the integral solution obtained from the rounding

process.

V. SIMULATION
In this section, we evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm through an extensive simulation study, and compare its performance with those of Randomized Compaction (RC) [7], ADJ-sum, and ADJ-minmax [6], the most relevant research that considers partially overlapping channel assignment. The objectives of ADJ-minmax and ADJ-sum, are to minimize the maximum interference among all interfering APs, and to minimize the sum of the weights on all conÔ¨Çict edges, respectively. RC, on the other hand, intends to minimize the maximum conÔ¨Çict vector that consists of the total number nodes interfering with each user arranged in non-increasing order. RC starts with a random channel assignment and reÔ¨Ånes the result iteratively.

Fig. 3. The channel utilization.

Note that all these algorithms are centralized and they are examined according to the following two performance metrics: (i) the per-user throughput; and (ii) the channel utilization ratio, which characterizes the utilization of each available channel and is deÔ¨Åned to be the ratio of the number of APs over the channel and the total number of APs.
There are two different scenarios in our simulation, the uniform and the hotspot cases, with both containing 20 APs and 50-250 users. For the uniform case, APs and users are placed uniformly at random in a 1400Ì†µÌ±ö √ó 900Ì†µÌ±ö √ó 10Ì†µÌ±ö region. In the hotspot case, to simulate high interference in the wireless environment, we place users in a certain area with 500Ì†µÌ±ö √ó 500Ì†µÌ±ö √ó 10Ì†µÌ±ö, while APs distribute uniformly at random in a 1000Ì†µÌ±ö √ó 500Ì†µÌ±ö √ó 10Ì†µÌ±ö region.
We solve the relaxed non-linear program (Eq. (10)) by LINGO and use QualNet as the simulator. We report our numerical simulation results, which are averaged over 50 runs with each taking 300s simulation time. Since the results are essentially similar, we only report the case with 20 APs and 150 users.
First, the per-user throughput is reported in Fig. 2, with the users sorted by their throughput in increasing order. From Fig. 2, we observe that our algorithm outperforms the other three algorithms in terms of per-user throughput for both network settings. The superiority of our algorithm is attributed to the interference factor Ì†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±ê, which helps to obtain a more appropriate channel assignment with a more accurate modeling. In summary, we conclude that our algorithm is superior in terms of throughput compared to others when partially overlapping channels are exploited.
Next, we show the utilization of each channel in Fig. 3. It can be seen that in both cases, MICA utilizes all channels while RC, ADJ-sum and ADJ-minmax only use a part of them. Furthermore, the variances of the channel utilization produced by our algorithm is smaller than those from others. The essential reason for these two results is that our algorithm allocates channels based on ‚Äúnode orthogonality‚Äù which takes into account both the channel separation and the physical distance separation while others assign channels based on the traditional channel orthogonality by only considering the channel separation. This indicates that the ‚Äúnode orthogonality‚Äù can help to mitigate interference.

VI. CONCLUSION
The widespread use of WLAN applications drives a high density deployment of APs, leading to an increase in interference and a decrease in the network performance. In this paper, we study how to mitigate interference and improve the network performance by allocating partially overlapping channels. A novel interference model characterized by the interference factor Ì†µÌ∞ºÌ†µÌ±ê is introduced, which takes into account both the channel separation and the physical distance separation of the two nodes. Based on this model, we formulate an interference minimization problem and propose a heuristic algorithm MICA. Our simulation study indicates that MICA outperforms RC, ADJ-sum, and ADJ-minmax in terms of peruser throughput and channel utilization ratio under both the uniform and the hot-spot user deployment patterns.
