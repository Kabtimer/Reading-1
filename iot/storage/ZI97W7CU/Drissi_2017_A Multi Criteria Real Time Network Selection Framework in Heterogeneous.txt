ABSTRACT
Network selection receives considerable attention from communication networks researchers. This remarkable interest is motivated by the variety of the existing technologies and the oﬀered services. The widespread use of these services leads to growth in the expectations and requirements of mobile users in terms of eﬃciency. This thesis focuses on proposing and evaluating new network selection models for heterogeneous wireless networks, and providing a real-time selection of always best connected network while maintaining the QoS for diﬀerent multimedia services. The main contribution consists of the proposal of a model of multi-criteria network selection. This model is open in the sense that it can accommodate the implementation of diﬀerent parameters in the decision of the network that may be selected, considering the type of application used by the mobile user. This thesis is developed from two aspects: Network selection algorithms proposition and performance study.
In the ﬁrst part, three complementary solutions were proposed to enable a fair and thoughtful allocation of resources and serve a maximum number of users. First, we study the problem of network selection using the decision-making strategy MADM (Multi-Criteria Decision Making). It consists of choosing the best network according to several criteria using a batch of weights generated with the AHP method. We propose, therefore, a weight improvement based on fuzzy logic, FAHP. In order to take into account the speed of mobile users, we propose a context-aware network selection based on a new utility function that takes into account the user’s preferences and the quality of service requirements in a high mobility scenario. We also improve the latter solution by proposing a network selection algorithm that provides a load balancing technique based on matching game theory to overcome network overload conditions in high-speed scenarios. In the second part, the performance study has been evaluated for two scenario types: Cellular and Vehicular. The proposed algorithms were evaluated and validated in both mobile and vehicular environments using the NS3 simulator.
Keywords: Heterogeneous Networks; Vertical Handover; Network Selection; Multi-Criteria Decision; Matching Theory; Cellular Networks; Vehicular Networks.

La s´election du r´eseau rec¸oit une attention consid´erable des chercheurs en r´eseaux de communication. Cet int´erˆet remarquable est motiv´e par la vari´et´e des technologies existantes et des services oﬀerts. L’utilisation g´en´eralis´ee de ces services entraˆıne une croissance des attentes et des exigences des utilisateurs mobiles en termes d’eﬃcacit´e. Cette th`ese se concentre sur la proposition et l’´evaluation de nouveaux mod`eles de s´election de r´eseau pour des r´eseaux sans ﬁl h´et´erog`enes. Elle fournit une s´election en temps r´eel du r´eseau toujours mieux connect´e tout en maintenant la qualit´e de service pour diﬀ´erents services multim´edias. La principale contribution consiste a` proposer un mod`ele de s´election multicrit`eres de r´eseaux. Ce mod`ele est ouvert dans le sens ou` il peut accueillir la mise en œuvre de diﬀ´erents param`etres dans la d´ecision du r´eseau s´electionn´e, en consid´erant le type d’application utilis´ee par l’utilisateur mobile. Cette th`ese est d´evelopp´ee a` partir de deux aspects: proposition d’algorithmes de s´election de r´eseau et ´etude de performance.
Dans la premi`ere partie, trois solutions compl´ementaires ont ´et´e propos´ees pour permettre une r´epartition ´equitable et r´eﬂ´echie des ressources et servir un nombre maximal d’utilisateurs. En premier lieu, nous ´etudions le probl`eme de la s´election du r´eseau en utilisant la strat´egie de prise de d´ecision MADM (L’aide a` la d´ecision multicrit`ere). Il s’agit de choisir le meilleur r´eseau selon plusieurs crit`eres a` l’aide d’un lot de poids g´en´er´es avec la m´ethode AHP. Nous proposons, ainsi, une am´elioration de poids bas´ee sur la logique ﬂoue FAHP. Aﬁn de tenir compte de la vitesse des utilisateurs mobiles, nous proposons une s´election de r´eseau d’acc`es contextuelle bas´ee sur une nouvelle fonction d’utilit´e qui prend en compte les pr´ef´erences de l’utilisateur et les conditions requises en termes de qualit´e de service dans un sc´enario a` mobilit´e ´elev´ee.

La s´election du r´eseau rec¸oit une attention consid´erable des chercheurs en r´eseaux de communication. Cet int´erˆet remarquable est motiv´e par la vari´et´e des technologies existantes et des services oﬀerts. L’utilisation g´en´eralis´ee de ces services entraˆıne une croissance des attentes et des exigences des utilisateurs mobiles en termes d’eﬃcacit´e.
Cette th`ese se concentre sur la proposition et l’´evaluation de nouveaux mod`eles de s´election de r´eseau pour des r´eseaux sans ﬁl h´et´erog`enes et en fournissant une s´election en temps r´eel du r´eseau toujours mieux connect´e tout en maintenant la qualit´e de service pour diﬀ´erents services multim´edias. Cette th`ese est d´evelopp´ee a` partir de deux aspects: proposition d’algorithmes de s´election de r´eseau et ´etude de performance. Dans la premi`ere partie, trois solutions compl´ementaires ont ´et´e propos´ees pour permettre une r´epartition ´equitable et r´eﬂ´echie des ressources et servir un nombre maximal d’utilisateurs. La principale contribution consiste `a proposer un mod`ele de s´election multicrit`eres de r´eseaux. Ce mod`ele est ouvert dans le sens ou` il peut accueillir la mise en œuvre de diﬀ´erents param`etres dans la d´ecision du r´eseau qui peut ˆetre s´electionn´ee, en consid´erant le type d’application utilis´ee par l’utilisateur mobile. Dans la deuxi`eme partie, l’´etude de performance a ´et´e ´evalu´ee pour deux types de sc´enarios: cellulaire et v´ehiculaire. Les algorithmes propos´es ont ´et´e ´evalu´es dans des environnements mobiles et v´ehiculaires. Ce m´emoire est constitu´e de six chapitres, en plus de l’introduction et la conclusion qui peuvent ˆetre r´esum´es comme suit :
Le premier chapitre donne des informations de base sur des r´eseaux h´et´erog`enes ainsi qu’un aperc¸u des sch´emas de s´election de r´eseau. Nous pr´esentons l’´evolution des r´eseaux sans ﬁls mobiles en termes d’exigences derri`ere chaque g´en´eration et discutons des solutions pour faire face a` la croissance exponentielle d’utilisation. Enﬁn, nous d´etaillons le probl`eme de Handover. Le Simulateur NS3 est pr´esent´e en annexe, ´etant l’outil que nous avons utilis´e dans toutes nos campagnes de simulations.
Dans le chapitre suivant, nous donnons un etat d’art sur la litt´erature et discutons les diﬀerentes strat´egies de s´election de r´eseau existantes. Nous r´esumons les sch´emas classiques bas´es sur MADM, Logique ﬂoue, Fonction d’Utilit´e et th´eorie de correspondance. Ils sont introduits comme les algorithmes de r´ef´erence du travail principal de la th`ese. en plus de quelques travaux r´ecents concernant les sc´enarios v´ehiculaires dans les syst`emes 5G.
Les chapitres suivants sont subdivis´es en deux parties. Dans la premi`ere partie, nous pr´esentons le mod`ele syst`eme des contributions. Dans la deuxi`eme partie, les algorithmes propos´es sont ´evalu´es dans des environnements mobiles et v´ehicules en temps r´eel.
Dans le troisi`eme chapitre, nous ´etudions le probl`eme de la s´election du r´eseau en utilisant une strat´egie de prise de d´ecision appel´ee MADM (L’aide a` la d´ecision multicrit`ere), l’une des meilleures strat´egies de s´election de r´eseau utilis´ees pour le handover vertical dans des r´eseaux sans ﬁl h´et´erog`enes. Les m´ethodes MADM consistent a` choisir le meilleur r´eseau a` partir de ceux disponibles selon plusieurs crit`eres. Dans ce premier ensemble de contributions, nous proposons un syst`eme de s´election multicrit`eres de r´eseau dans lequel nous comparons les

xii
algorithmes de d´ecision: VIKOR, SAW, MEW et TOPSIS a` l’aide d’un lot de poids g´en´er´es avec la m´ethode AHP. Sur cette base, nous proposons une am´elioration de poids bas´ee sur la logique ﬂoue qui, en termes de qualit´e de service, am´eliorera la s´election du r´eseau dans un environnement h´et´erog`ene.
Dans l’algorithme pr´ec´edent, le handover vertical est trait´e sans tenir compte de la vitesse des utilisateurs mobiles ni des conditions de surcharge du r´eseau, ce qui pourrait se produire dans le cas rare d’un grand nombre de terminaux et d’applications utilisant le cadre propos´e et en comp´etition sur le mˆeme r´eseau. Ces limites sont confront´ees par le deuxi`eme et troisi`eme algorithmes propos´es, present´ees dans le quatri`eme chapitre, ou` une nouvelle s´election de r´eseau bas´ee sur l’utilit´e est propos´ee et ensuite am´elior´ee a` l’aide de la th´eorie des jeux de correspondance dans le but d’´equilibrer la charge sur la topologie disponible. Nous ´etudions donc le probl`eme de la s´election du r´eseau a` partir de la satisfaction qu’un r´eseau fournit aux utilisateurs mobiles. Diﬀ´erents r´eseaux disponibles avec diﬀ´erentes pr´ef´erences d’utilisateur auront diﬀ´erentes valeurs d’utilit´e. Nous proposons une s´election de r´eseau d’acc`es contextuelle bas´ee sur une nouvelle fonction d’utilit´e qui prend en compte les pr´ef´erences de l’utilisateur et les conditions requises en termes de qualit´e de service. Elle vise a` maximiser la satisfaction de l’utilisateur tout en rencontrant les exigences de qualit´e de service des applications lors de la connexion au r´eseau cible dans un sc´enario a` mobilit´e ´elev´ee. En outre, nous am´eliorons cette derni`ere solution en proposant un algorithme de s´election de r´eseau qui fournit une technique d’´equilibrage de charge bas´ee sur la th´eorie de correspondance. Ce sch´ema se concentre sur la possibilit´e d’invocation simultan´ee d’applications avec diﬀ´erentes caract´eristiques de traﬁc et de qualit´e de service. Nous formulons, par cons´equent, notre probl`eme en tant que jeu de correspondance, visant a` r´epondre aux besoins des utilisateurs cellulaires en termes de qualit´e de service requise, ces derniers distribu´es de mani`ere al´eatoire dans la couverture des r´eseaux h´et´erog`enes. Nous proposons un algorithme qui calcule la correspondance stable optimale impliquant l’aﬀectation de tous les utilisateurs au r´eseau le plus appropri´e en consid´erant le type de service dont chaque utilisateur a besoin dans les sc´enarios a` grande vitesse.
Dans le cinqui`eme chapitre, les ´evaluations de performance, les solutions propos´ees sont ´evalu´ees. Dans un environnement h´et´erog`ene, compos´e de r´eseaux LTE-WiFi, nous pr´esentons les d´etails des simulations et discutons les r´esultats. Les algorithmes propos´es ont ´et´e ´evalu´es et valid´es dans des environnements mobiles et v´ehiculaires en utilisant le simulateur NS3. Les trois algorithmes sont ´evalu´es dans le but de prouver leur applicabilit´e dans un environnement mobile en consid´erant les applications cellulaires, a` savoir, Conversationnelle, Streaming, Interactive et Background.
En outre, dans les sc´enarios a` grande vitesse, tels que v´ehiculaire, la s´election du r´eseau d´edi´ee aux syst`emes 5G est plus critique. Ainsi, dans le dernier chapitre, nous avons appliqu´e, par cons´equent, l’algorithme propos´e pr´ec´edemment qui calcule l’appariement stable optimal pour impliquer l’aﬀectation de tous les v´ehicules dans une topologie a` grande ´echelle au r´eseau le plus appropri´e en consid´erant le type de service requis par chaque v´ehicule, notamment: Conduite avanc´ee, conduite a` distance, Platooning et capteur ´etendu. cet algorithme a ´et´e appliqu´e au r´eseau de v´ehicules h´et´erog`ene bas´e sur LTE d´edi´e aux syst`emes 5G dans les sc´enarios v´ehiculaires. Les r´esultats montrent que l’algorithme propos´e est plus pr´ecis par rapport aux algorithmes de r´ef´erence pour les applications cellulaires et v´ehiculaires.

INTRODUCTION
1 Context
Wireless networks have gained tremendous popularity in the communication industry and have become one of the most signiﬁcant technological breakthroughs in the past few decades. In the past, it was diﬃcult to assume the telecommunication service can be provided to people regardless of their geographical location and while they are moving around. But, it is very diﬃcult now for many people to imagine life without continuous availability of wireless communication. Telecommunication technology has indeed completed its biggest improvement in just a few years and in the example of wireless communication, its growth has far exceeded the most optimistic expectations.
In recent years, various types of wireless access technologies have been deployed including 802.11 Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), 802.16 Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) Wang et al. (2008), long-Term Evolution (LTE) Heath Jr et al. (2016) and Light Fidelity (Li-Fi)Bao et al. (2015). The most promising Next Generation Networks (NGN) are the heterogeneous networks. They are based on the coexistence and interoperability of the diﬀerent types of Radio Access Technologies (RAT), and support existing and emerging networks. Indeed, Mobile terminals are equipped with multiple interfaces can handover seamlessly between heterogeneous networks to guarantee the continuity of an ongoing application session such as Voice over IP (VoIP) and on-line gaming, adopting by that the concept of Always Best Connected (ABC) Concept. Authors (Gustafsson and Jonsson, 2003) assert that a terminal supports the ABC features means that it is not only always connected, but also connected through the best available network and access technology at all times. The ABC concept achieves a win-win partnership because it considers user’s and operator’s beneﬁts since it includes basically all types of access technologies. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous wireless networks require an intelligent network selection algorithm to establish seamless communication in order to provide high Quality of Service (QoS) for diﬀerent multimedia applications. The major issue for the heterogeneous networks is Network Selection, i.e., a smooth and eﬃcient handover scheme that allows the roaming of mobile devices from one wireless system to another.
To provide pervasive wireless access for users, it is important to choose the best network among the available ones. Being the key for resource management in a wireless heterogeneous network, dynamic network selection process intend to provide users with the required QoS in terms of metrics and user’s

2

Introduction

preferences since both are acknowledged during the process of network selection. Hence, this technology is a hot research topic in the ﬁeld of wireless communication. Indeed, Heterogeneous networks involve development of diverse paradigms of the concerned technologies, such as context-awareness of mobile devices and QoS awareness. Communication in such environment has to cope with many provider’s constraints (e.g., strong ﬂuctuations of Real-time traﬃc and dynamic network topology) and also it has to meet user’s application requirements. In addition to ABC functionalities, heterogeneous systems bring many promising paradigms aiming to deliver signiﬁcantly higher capacity to meet the huge growth of mobile data traﬃc.
Whereas the previous generations of cellular systems have been primarily designed towards increased spectral eﬃciencies to enable bandwidth greedy applications for users, the development of a 5G radio access attended to the conclusion that the latest and next generation of cellular communication systems will be driven by newly arisen use cases Alliance (2015). The 5G radio access will have to acknowledge a number of requirements advanced by a large collection of diﬀerent new services, such as those from the context of massive Machine-Type Communication (mMTC) and ultra-reliable MTC (urMTC). As the name suggests, mMTC is about massive access by a large number of devices, i.e., about providing wireless connectivity to tens of billions of often low-complexity low-power machine-type devices. On the other hand, urMTC is about providing adequate wireless links for network services with rather stringent requirements on availability, latency and reliability. For the concept of urMTC, an important technology is Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications Bockelmann et al. (2016). V2X communication has the ability to eﬃciently improve the application like road safety and traﬃc eﬃciency services, as well as highly autonomous driving. As a consequence, a ”One-Network” solution for the air interface as prevailing in today’s radio systems would no longer be the suitable solution in the future, as it can barely provide an inadequate compromise. Instead, the system should provide more ﬂexibility and scalability to enable tailoring the system conﬁgurations to the service types and their demands Dohler and Nakamura (2016). Moreover, as the data rates to be provided by mobile radio systems are always increasing, technologies need to take advantage of the last bit from the limited spectrum resources.

2 Motivation for this thesis
Next generation wireless networks entangle a disparate number of technologies. For the next three years, CiscoCisco Visual Networking (2015) expected that the mobile data traﬃc increases of nearly eightfold and reaches 30.6 exabytes (1018) by 2020. This exponential increase in throughput demand must be accompanied with an increase, at the same speed, in network capacity. Due to resources limitations, coverage issues and mobile user’s swollen demands, a single communication is deﬁnitely not qualiﬁed to deliver continuous mobile services and cannot aﬀord the recommended QoS while bestowing all connected user’s demanding applications.
Furthermore, The widespread use of mobile and high deﬁnition video devices is changing internet traﬃc, with a signiﬁcant increase in multimedia content, especially Video on Demand (VoD). A crucial

2. MOTIVATION FOR THIS THESIS

challenge is that heterogeneous networks require strict QoS including better latency, reliability, higher spectral and energy eﬃciency, but also need an improved Quality of Experience (QoE) for users of wireless services in 4G and beyond networks. Nevertheless, the coexistence of other networks with diﬀerent access technologies overlapping each other’s, and the mobility of the users in the coverage areas of the available networks is the opportune solution in such heterogeneous environment.
In V2X use cases, traditional wireless communication technologies such as 2G/3G/LTE cannot satisfy the demand of aforementioned high reliability and low latency, together, in the V2X communication scenarios. Thus, there is a need of new communication technologies to support the V2X communication. Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is deemed to be a feasible solutions for the V2X communication Ye et al. (2016). Indeed, VANETs is one of the eﬀective technologies to enhance traﬃc safety, in-which vehicles are connected in a form of network so that every vehicle can be aware of others’ state information, such as velocity and direction. Although VANETs seems to be among the future V2X communication technologies, fast moving speed of vehicles is a challenging condition, diﬃcult to be handled by VANETs, and already managed by LTE. In addition, and to the best of our knowledge, the majority of researches are working on the development of this technologies under ”one-network” and ignore the situation of heterogeneous environment which is well-handled by LTE network through the handover procedure.
However, the heterogeneity of access technologies involves four major problems to which we will be interested in this thesis:
 How to transfer a communication from a network (source network) to a another network (target network) without discontinuity and with better quality of service?
 When the mobile user must change its source network to attach to another target network?
 How is the decision made to choose the best available network in terms of quality of service?
 What is the unit responsible for decision-making (network, user, etc.)?
The potent network selection algorithm is foreseen to grant the users with the recommended QoS per applications in terms of networks link state and user’s pre-requisites. Hence, both QoS requirements and user’s preferences are approved during the network selection process. To meet these requirements, mobile terminals have to select the suitable access network that ﬁt for their QoS requirements of applications; escape a network with high traﬃc load for avoiding congestion and also minimize costs by handling an intelligent network selection allowing mobile devices to make appropriate and timely decisions on behalf of users. Therein, real time access point selection is the key for a ﬂawless resource management strategy to an eﬃcient exploit of coexistence in heterogeneous networks.
Several technical challenges arise, such as, Seamless Handover; where the transfer of a mobile user happens without service discontinuity; the assurance of good QoS, mobility management, network resource management, and ensuring a balance to satisfy both the needs of the users and operators. There are also other factors to consider (security, authentication, etc.) that play an important role during the handover process. All these hypotheses open the door wide open to the research and the design of

4

Introduction

decision-making solutions based on several parameters that manage a transparent transfer of the mobile node between the networks (imperceptibly by the user). The handover procedure within 3GPP LTE deﬁned in LTE (2011), has three main phases: Handover initiation, handover preparation (Network Selection) and handover execution. The ﬁrst two phases are highly important that in the literature claims that the ﬁrst two phases provide 90% of the handover delay Khan et al. (2017); Lee and Cho (2011).
Wherefore, this feature is a trendy research matter in the area of wireless communication.

3 Author’s contribution
This thesis focus on proposing and evaluating network selection models for heterogeneous wireless networks, and providing a real-time selection of always best connected network while maintaining QoS for diﬀerent multimedia services. The objective of this thesis is mainly to implement three complementary solutions enabling networks a fair and thoughtful allocation of resources to serve the most possible users. The main contribution consists of the proposal of a model of multi-criteria selection of networks. This model is open in the sense that it can accommodate the implementation of diﬀerent parameters in the decision of the network that may be selected, regarding the type of application used by the mobile user. Two approaches are proposed and studied in both mobile and vehicular environments, based on nine original publications, including four journal papers, two book chapters and three conference papers.
3.1 A Multi-Criteria Approach for Network Selection in Heterogeneous Environment using MADM:
The ﬁrst approach is a novel strategy called Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM), one of the best network selection methods used for Vertical Handover Decision (VHD) in heterogeneous wireless networks. MADM consist in choosing the best network from available ones.
3.1.1 Evaluation of Multi-Criteria Vertical Handover for Heterogeneous Wireless Networks
Drissi and Oumsis (2015b) In this paper we studied the use of MADM used to choose the best network from available networks. We compared handover decision algorithms: Simple Additive Weighting (SAW), Multiplicative Exponential Weighting (MEW) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) in terms of end-to-end delay and packet loss using two available networks Wi-Fi and WiMAX. All algorithms allow diﬀerent attributes (e.g., bandwidth, delay, Jitter and Bite Error rate) to be included in the decision.
3.1.2 Multi-Criteria Vertical Handover Comparison Between WiMAX and WiFi Drissi and Oumsis (2015a) We studied, in this paper, the beneﬁt of MADM methods for network selection. We compared three of these methods naming SAW, MEW and TOPSIS in a real-time. In which

3. AUTHOR’S CONTRIBUTION

5

Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method provides the weights of attributes which allow the comparison in diﬀerent types of applications. We proposed a set of weights contributing to improved delay and packet loss in diﬀerent types of applications.

3.1.3 VIKOR for multi-criteria network selection in heterogeneous wireless networks
Drissi et al. (2016a) We proposed an automatic and real-time selection of the next handed network in heterogeneous environment consisting of Wi-Fi and WiMAX networks, while maintaining the best QoS. We propose, thereby, a network selection scheme based on VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method. VIKOR belongs to MADM family, which consider multiple attributes for the decision of the best available alternatives. We compared and approved the proposed scheme with other MADM methods as baseline schemes, namely, SAW, MEW and TOPSIS from the previous work.

3.1.4 A Fuzzy AHP Approach to Network Selection Improvement in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks
Drissi et al. (2016b) In this paper, we proposed an algorithm for network selection based on Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP), applied to determine the relative weights of the evaluation criteria. The contribution consists of a fuzzy optimization model to solve Multi-Criteria Vertical Handover based on a FAHP. To deal with the imprecise judgements of decision makers involved by classical AHP, a FAHPdecision-making model aim is to determine the weights of certain QoS indicators that act as the criteria impacting the decision process.

3.1.5 A Multi-Criteria Decision Framework for Network Selection over LTE and WLAN
Drissi et al. (2017d) The aim of this paper is to select the appropriate network for a certain type of traﬃc considering a number of QoS metrics. Network selection problem is solved using a combination of MADM methods. Due to the interaction between the criteria, AHP is applied to determine the weight of the criterion (QoSmetrics) for each alternative (type of traﬃc). Since FAHP decision model conﬁrmed its eﬃciency to ascertain the weights of QoS metrics that impact the decision process without prejudice, we led the FAHP scheme further in proving its performance with the other well reputed methods, MEW, TOPSIS and VIKOR in order to sort the accessible networks. The empirical results showed that FAHP schemes, compared with classical AHP ones, achieve a momentous reﬁnement in terms of delay and Packet Loss Rate. Furthermore, in pursuance of minimizing delay and packet loss, the most suitable schemes are suggested for each type of traﬃc.

3.2 Matching Game for Access Point Selection in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks:
The second approach is the utility function. For network selection decision, utility function assigned to the satisfaction that a network provides to mobile users. Diﬀerent available networks with diﬀerent user preferences will have diﬀerent utility values.

Introduction

3.2.1 A Context-Aware Access Network Selection Based on Utility-Function for Handover in WLAN-LTE Environment
Drissi et al. (2017a) In this paper we proposed a context-aware access network selection based on utility function that takes into consideration user’s and QoS preferences. It aims at maximizing the user satisfaction while meeting application QoS when connecting to a target network. The proposed approach prioritizes networks with higher relevance to diﬀerent types of applications and enables seamless connectivity to mobile user and applications. Thus, network resources are conveniently managed to support diverse services that might be considered by mobile users. Results are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in low, medium and high mobility scenarios consisting in WLAN-LTE networks compared with the existing baseline scheme.

3.2.2 User-Driven Handover Scheme in Long-Term Evolution (LTE) Macro/Femto Cells for High Speed Scenarios
Drissi et al. (2016c) Ubiquitous communication depends upon an expanded capacity and suitable QoS. To meet these requirements, LTE mobile network providers deploy small cells in shadow zones and next to base station to increase the network capacity and coverage for Mobile users. An optimal cell selection scheme in such scenario allows User Equipment (UE) to reconnect to the most convenient cell while maintaining its QoS requirements. To this end, this paper presents an UE triggered handover where cell selection is performed by mobile terminal instead of classical cell selection where the process is launched and controlled by Evolved Node B (eNB). A comprehensive analysis of the proposed scheme is presented, compared with classical handover triggered by (eNB) at varying speeds to demonstrate its robustness.
This approach is enhanced using the matching game theory, a winning the 2012 Nobel Prize, which provides a mathematically tractable method for personnel assignment problem in two distinct sets. In wireless networks, the matching is applied for mobile users and access points.

3.2.3 A Load Balanced Network Selection Algorithm in Heterogeneous Networks using Matching Game
Drissi et al. (2017c) Through this paper, we proposed a solution that provides a context-aware access point selection and association of UE, which considers the type of application used, to available networks in the LTE and Wi-Fi environment. This scheme focuses on enabling simultaneous invocation of applications with diﬀerent traﬃc and QoS characteristics by the UEs. This solution considers also various link parameters that provide the best solution in terms of QoS which makes it a QoS-aware solution as well. The real time context-aware and QoS-aware access point selection method is based on matching theory. We formulated, thereby, our problem as a matching game, aiming to meet the required QoS of cellular users, randomly distributed in LTE and Wi-Fi networks, then we proposed an algorithm that computes the optimal stable matching entailing the assignment of all users to the most suitable network regarding the type of the service each user need.

3.3 Application for Mobile and Vehicular Heterogeneous Networks:

In high-speed scenarios, such as vehicular, the selection of the network dedicated to 5G systems is more critical. Thus, in the last contribution, we have applied the matching algorithm proposed above, in a large scale topology considering vehicular applications.

3.3.1 Enabling Use Case Aware Handover in LTE-Based Heterogeneous Vehicular Network for 5G V2X Scenarios
Drissi et al. (2017b) V2X technology is one of the key technologies in Fifth Generation (5G) network. In V2X scenarios, being one of the 5G network slices, when safety-related applications are concerned, it should be ascertained that other use cases (non-safety) does not negatively aﬀect the QoS of such critical V2X applications. As vehicles can be driven without human intervention, and safety is been taken care of, human inside the vehicle will engage in other activities such as media consumption (e.g. browsing, or VoD). However, enabling seamless handover and always-best-connected services in such environment is a diﬃcult and challenging task. To address this issue, this paper proposes a use case aware network selection algorithm based on utility function that considers V2X applications requirements, for LTE-Based heterogeneous vehicular networks. A novel framework which uses the eNodeBs of the LTE network as an access point for V2X Scenarios. It aims at maximizing the satisfaction of the required service when connecting to a target network. We used, thereby, the previously proposed algorithm that computes the optimal stable matching entailing the assignment of all vehicles to the most suitable network regarding the type of the service each vehicle requires. The proposed approach prioritizes networks with higher relevance to diﬀerent use cases and enables seamless connectivity to vehicles. Simulations results are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in high mobility V2X scenarios compared with the existing baseline scheme.

4 Outline of the thesis
This thesis consists of six chapters, in addition to the introduction and conclusion. Chapter 1 gives background information of heterogeneous networks along with an overview of network
selection schemes. We present the evolution of mobile wireless networks in terms of requirements and technologies behind each generation, and discuss solutions to face with this exponential growth and we detail the handover issue. Also the Network Simulator 3 (NS3) is presented as an annex, being the tool we used in all our simulations campaigns.
Chapter 2 gives a literature survey and discusses several existing network selection strategies. We summarize the classical MADM-based, Fuzzy-Logic-based, Utility-Function-based and Matching-Theorybased schemes in addition to some recent works dealing with the V2X scenarios in the 5G systems. They are introduced as the reference algorithms of the thesis’s main work.
The next chapters are subdivided in two parts. In the ﬁrst part, we present the system model of

Introduction

the contributions. In the second part, the proposed algorithms are evaluated in real time Mobile and Vehicular environments.
In Chapter 3, we detail the contributions made using MADM approach. First, we present an architecture of our selection algorithm, which has been implemented in two variants of weighting distribution algorithms AHP and FAHP and we present the mathematical modelling of diﬀerent network selection strategies considered in this approach. We explain the functioning of each variant and present some limitation of the contribution.
In Chapter 4, the process of selecting the always best connected network in real-time is detailed, while maintaining the required QoS for multimedia services such as: Conversational, Streaming, Interactive and Background traﬃc. Using utility-function based approach, we captured the satisfaction level of mobile user with this scheme in the purpose of enhancing vertical handover decision. In addition, we present its improvement using the fuzzy weights proposed in the previous chapter. This algorithm is enhanced using Matching Theory Game. We detail the proposed system model being a context-aware and QoS-aware access point selection method in real time based on matching theory, aiming to meet the required QoS of cellular users in an heterogeneous wireless networks and show how it is eﬀective for avoiding the severe congestion of one network, ensuring load balancing, improving access point selection and user admission to another available network.
In chapter 5, performance evaluations the proposed solutions are assessed. In an heterogeneous environment, consisting of LTE-Wi-Fi networks, we present the details of the simulations and discuss the outcomes.
In chapter 6, the matching algorithm is applied to LTE-Based heterogeneous vehicular network dedicated to 5G systems in V2X Scenarios.
In the conclusion, we summarize the main results of this thesis and look into the perspectives of future researches.

1.1 Introduction
Wireless networks have revolutionized the world of telephony since they have allowed users to communicate even when they are mobile. Today, mobile networks are victims of their own success. In recent years, the revolution in mobile terminals, notably with the appearance of smart phones, has led operators to oﬀer several services that are more bandwidth intensive and have more stringent real-time constraints. In addition, the diversity of services oﬀered has led to an explosion in the number of subscribers. The mobile network must provide suﬃcient capacity to serve all network clients and ensure faster processing services used. Faced with these constraints, operators must ensure the development of mobile networks while guaranteeing a certain QoS adapted to the services oﬀered. In fact, they have to ﬁnd the right compromise between, on the one hand, this QoS, and on the other hand the limited capacity and the cost of deploying such a network (energy cost, development cost, maintenance cost, etc.). In this chapter, we lay out the background of heterogeneous wireless networks and detail the wireless network evolution by outlining requirements and techniques used in each wireless network. Then, we outline the main problem of Network Selection. Finally, we introduce some solutions made to manage this latter.
1.2 Background: Heterogeneous Wireless Networks
Before wireless networks come to the stage they reached today, they went through several states of speciﬁcation and standardization processes. In this section, we examine the evolution of mobile networks.

CHAPTER 1. NETWORK SELECTION FOR MULTI-HOMED USERS IN HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS: AN OVERVIEW

Wireless technologies can be categorized into four classes, characterized by the size of their coverage area and the throughput oﬀered by the network. The ﬁrst class concerns Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN) characterized by a low range (order of a few tens of meters), and a low throughput.. The second class concerns Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) characterized by a range of about one hundred meters. The WLAN class contains several competing technologies such as IEEE 802.11. Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks (WMAN) represents the third class. These networks were originally intended to interconnect geographical areas with diﬃcult access. They have a range of some tens of kilometers like the WiMAX network. Finally, the fourth class concerns Wireless Wide Area Networks (WWAN). This category is also known as mobile Cellular Networks. These are the most widely used wireless networks in the ﬁeld of telecommunications.

Figure 1.1: Evolution of Mobile Technologies.
1.2.1 Scope of Wireless Networks
Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN)
The range of a WPAN network does not exceed a few tens of meters. This type of network is typically used to connect peripherals such as a printer, a cell phone, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), connect a remote control to a television set, and so on. The main technology used with this category of wireless networks is the IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth) standard launched by Ericsson in 1994 with a bit rate of 1 Mbps and with a coverage of no more than 30 meters. It is known for its high energy consumption. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard (ZigBee) with low power consumption and infrared links represent other examples of wireless networks that can transmit data over a few tens of meters.

1.2. BACKGROUND: HETEROGENEOUS WIRELESS NETWORKS

Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN)

The range of a WLAN network is a few hundred meters (300 meters) and is often used in companies to connect computers and printers. A well-known example of this type of network is the well-known Wi-Fi with a throughput of up to 54 Mbps and a range of several hundred meters. Another example of WLAN is HiperLAN2 which is a European standard oﬀering a bit rate equivalent to Wi-Fi(with 54 Mbps and a range of 300 meters).

IEEE 802.11 Standard: Wi-Fi It is one of the standards that enables a wireless network to be deployed by communicating a plurality of devices (computer, PDA, cell, etc.) together, across the radio wave and to a high-speed link over a nearly equal coverage radius A few tens of meters. Wi-Fi is used in airports, cafes, etc. The IEEE 802.11 standard oﬀered a throughput of between 1 and 2 Mbps. For reasons of performance improvement (range, throughput, etc.), this standard has undergone several evolutions through the appearance of diﬀerent versions.

IEEE 802.11p Standard: VANETs VANETs is an emerging new technology integrating ad-hoc network and WLAN to achieve intelligent inter-vehicle communications and improve road traﬃc safety and eﬃciency. VANETs are distinguished from other kinds of ad-hoc networks by their node movement characteristics, and new application scenarios. Therefore, VANETs pose many unique networking research challenges, and the design of an eﬃcient routing protocol for VANETs is very crucial.

Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks (WMAN)
This type of network aims to provide a wider coverage than its predecessors while oﬀering a throughput of 1 to 10 Mbps and a range of 4 to 10 km. With this type of network, the radio wave allows several companies to be Interconnected or connecting diﬀerent buildings in the same neighborhood, etc. An example of this network is IEEE 802.16, WiMAX)

IEEE 802.16 Standard: WiMAX It is a technology mainly used for WMANthat aim to provide a broadband internet connection over a coverage area several kilometers radius. The theoretical rate of WiMAX is of the order of 70 Mbps with a range of 50 kilometers. WiMAX technology proposes to introduce mobility features into its network: a WiMAX terminal can move while maintaining reliable access to the network. This feature is introduced by the IEEE 802.16e standard which can be classiﬁed in WMAN. WiMAX works in point-to-point mode, that is to say the infrastructure mode known for WiWi-Fi, or the same functioning as the 2G, 3G technologies of mobile telephony. Thus, as in 2G, a base station called Base Transceiver Station (BTS) or Base Station (BS) transmits to the clients and receives their requests and then transmits them to the provider’s network. Several variants of standard have been

proposed, modiﬁed and ratiﬁed as summarized in Barja et al. (2012).

Wireless Wide Area Networks (WWAN)
This type of network is used by Telecommunication. Several well-known systems today use this type of network: the Global System For Mobile Communication (GSM) Tantani (2010), the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) ETSI (1998), the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio (2008), LTEEvolved Universal Terrestrial Radio (2010a) and LTE Advanced (LTE-A) Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio (2010b).

First Generation (1G) Mobile Networks The so-called First Generation (1G) is the network of the 1980s. The ﬁrst cellular network to use the same frequency channels for remote cells. Various standards existed throughout the world: Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS), Total Access Coverage System (TACS), RADIOCOM2000 (France), etc. This generation of network enabled the mobility of users and the use Of the ﬁrst SIM cards. Technically, this type of network is totally based on the analog signal and that is what characterizes it. The transmission rate is 10 Kbit/s and the communications are frequency modulated Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA). A channel is reserved exclusively for each call during the entire call. It is circuit-switched Akoka and Collectif (2006).

Second Generation (2G) Mobile Networks

GSM Network The Second Generation (2G) of mobile phone systems is characterized by the use of the digital signal, which allowed the transmission of small data and the appearance of text messages exchanged between clients. A multitude of standards have been considered throughout the world. Examples include iDEN (USA), PDC (Japan) and GSM (developed in Europe and used worldwide) Akoka and Collectif (2006). The GSM network, in particular, has enjoyed great success with more than one billion subscribers to its communication services in more than two hundred countries (82%) of mobile phones). It is a mobile phone system launched by the GSM in the 1990s. This network operates a wider range of Hertzian frequencies than previous networks. It is based on a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) resource sharing system; The resources of a base station are shared in time between the connected mobiles Tantani (2010) Akoka and Collectif (2006).

GPRS Network Originally, the GSM network is a system dedicated to voice. With the aim of increasing the transmission rate, the switching of the packets during the transmission of data was necessary. This led to a revision of the standards and the birth of the GPRS network. The latter is an advanced version of the GSM network and oﬀers a throughput of up to 80 Kbps. It allows the sharing of time and frequency resources Frequency Division Time Division Multiple Access (FD-TDMA), a hybrid

1.2. BACKGROUND: HETEROGENEOUS WIRELESS NETWORKS

mode between TDMAand FDMA. Data is transmitted in packets using the TCP/ IP protocol mainly. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) protocols are used to transfer data over the Internet and wired connections Fall and Stevens (2011). This protocol is used for the Internet, which allows customers to enjoy multimedia services. As for the voice, it is always transmitted by circuit switching. Most European countries adopted this standard in the summer of 2001 Akoka and Collectif (2006), Al Agha et al. (2001).

Enhanced Data Rates over GSM Evolution (EDGE) Network The continued need to increase transmission throughput and clients’ greed in terms of throughput has led the standardization groups to push the boundaries of networks and evolve the GPRS network. This gave birth to the EDGE . This new network allows clients to reach a speed three times faster (240 Kbps) thanks to new modulation and coding schemes. The EDGE standard is called the 2.75 generation Akoka and Collectif (2006).

Third Generation (3G) Mobile Networks

UMTS Network Until this generation, communication systems have been very successful and allow communication between mobiles with a suitable QoS. However, in order to generalize the multimedia services and prepare the networks of the future, a new generation had to be deﬁned. It is the Third Generation (3G) mobile networks. This generation allows to oﬀer with more ﬂexibility services more gourmand in bandwidth Akoka and Collectif (2006). It is based on the two types of switching circuits and packets; Circuits for voice and packets for other types of data (ﬁle transfers, web browsing ...). The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has deﬁned the UMTS along with the appearance of 2.5 and 2.75 generations. The implementation of this technology UMTS took place gradually and lasted a few years since several equipment had to be replaced. UMTS allows a bit rate up to 2Mbits/s under certain conditions. Indeed, this network has turned to multimedia services and user mobility using Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA) broadband code share. This enabled mobile customers to gain broadband access to the Internet without video conferencing and videoconferencing, as well as the reception of television on the telephone Al Agha et al. (2001). The technologies chosen by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), in the framework of 3G have been named IMT-2000 (International Mobile Telecommunication 2000). ITU manages radio frequency spectra globally, as well as satellite orbits in order to avoid interference between countries. It sets standards for communication systems to ensure the proper use of the spectrum. IMT-2000 is the result of a global collaboration between the various ITU standardization bodies.

High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) Network The evolution of UMTS technology, the so-called advanced third generation, was launched in 2000 with the introduction of HSPA standards. An even more advanced version then appeared, called HSPA+. These standards are called 3G + and 3G ++ networks.

14

CHAPTER 1. NETWORK SELECTION FOR MULTI-HOMED USERS IN HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS: AN OVERVIEW

This generation of networks is more oriented towards packet logic and oﬀers more capacity with higher throughput (up to 21Mbits s). This favors the development of new applications, in particular in the ﬁeld of multimedia (video telephony, broadcasting of video and audio content, MMS video or audio, etc.). Compared to previous generation networks, an advanced 3G network ensures that mobile clients can access web and e-mail data even when moving at a higher speed Al Agha et al. (2001).

Fourth Generation (4G) Mobile Networks With the evolution of the mobile terminal market (smart phones, tablets, notebooks, ...), telecommunication technologies have evolved towards an architecture known as all-IP. They are based only on packet switching. Indeed, let us recall that the previous generation 3G transmitted the text data (ﬁle, navigation, ...) by switching packets while the voice data was transmitted by circuit switching. In this generation of telecommunication Fourth Generation (4G), no distinction is made between voice and other data types. Packet switching is done through the TCP/IP protocol. This generation uses the coding and frequency multiplexing technique over time. This is a combination of the FDMA and TDMA modes used separately by previous generations. This mode of resource sharing is called Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA). Eﬀorts are continuously being made to respond to the changing needs of users in terms of mobile applications. LTE and WiMAX networks are among the emerging all-IP technologies recognized in this generation.

Cellular WiMAX The WiMAX network is a collection of IEEE 802.16 standards developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). WiMAX was designed in 2001 for point-topoint communications for high-speed wireless networks such as Wi-Fi. Since then, several versions have been developed to oﬀer more bandwidth Ergen (2009). The IEEE 802.16e variant targets the mobile communication market. The cellular network of this technology provides wireless Internet access and oﬀers mobile services with high bit rates (up to 70Mbits/s). The transmission and modulation techniques used in WiMAX networks facilitate deployment in urban areas and in large urban centers Etemad and Lai (2011)Ergen (2009).

LTE Network LTE technology is the result of the natural evolution of the mobile communication networks developed by the 3GPP standardization group. As it was presented at the beginning by 3GPP, the LTE standard was not recognized as a 4th generation of mobile networks since it did not satisfy the conditions imposed by the ITU. For this, 3GPP has introduced improvements to LTE technology to make it a new generation 4G network Etemad and Lai (2011). The LTE network is designed to last and is based primarily on GSM/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA technologies. The architecture of this network is distinguished by the separation of the control entity from the network entity that handles the user plane. This allows better management of the network equipment and facilitates the operations of intervention and maintenance of mobile operators on these equipment. This separation oﬀers a lower latency time (estimated at an average of 5ms) compared to that of other networks (estimated at 300ms for UMTS)

1.2. BACKGROUND: HETEROGENEOUS WIRELESS NETWORKS

Etemad and Lai (2011) Akoka and Collectif (2006).The spectral eﬃciency of LTE networks provides additional capacity to the cells. This is reﬂected in the number of mobiles served simultaneously by the same cell and the ﬂow rate that is oﬀered to them even when moving at a high speed. Indeed, the architecture of the LTE network remains functional up to a speed of 350kmh.

LTE Advanced Network The 3GPP group proposed the advanced version of LTE that allows auto-conﬁguration and self-organization of base stations. That is, the parameters of the latter can be adapted to the various changes that can occur in the network (deployment of a neighboring cell, variation in spectral allocation, etc.). The advanced LTE network also allows the deployment of small cells by the mobile operator itself or by its customers. This type of cells comes to complement locally the regular coverage of the network and it o ers an additional capacity. Thus, the network is said to be heterogeneous Etemad and Lai (2011)Akoka and Collectif (2006).

Fifth Generation (5G) Mobile Networks The ITU has developed a global road map for the development of 5G mobile systems, which it named IMT-2020 on June 19, 2015. ITU attention is now focused on the possibility of creating a continuously connected society by 2020 and beyond. A society in which people as well as objects, data, applications, transportation systems and cities would be grouped together in an environment under the sign of intelligent networked communications. The ITU will continue to work in partnership with the global mobile systems industry and with government agencies to ensure the practical implementation of IMT-2020. The goals of this generation include improvements in customer experience, privacy and data security. This will provide a wide range of emerging services. Improvements in the network architecture also aim at its ease of use and its energy and operational eﬃciency. In this thesis, the challenges of handover management were studied with diﬀerent mobile network standards and wireless such as Wi-Fi, WiMAX and LTE. In the next section, we introduce the handover process.
Wireless Networks: Synthesis and Comparison
The variety of existing wireless communications standards raises the problem of the choice of the technology to be adopted to meet the needs of mobile users. To facilitate this choice, a comparative analysis between diﬀerent mobile technologies remains necessary in order to choose the best technology. Table 1.1 presents the key elements of this comparative analysis. In this comparison, we focus on a set of relevant parameters such as throughput, coverage, cost of service, mobility speed, energy consumption, etc. We note that the two technologies of the 4G: WIMAX and LTE allow to improve the performances of a radio-mobile communication compared to the 3G or the 2G, in particular in terms of rate, coverage and cost.

1.2.2 Heterogeneous Networks

Figure 1.2: An illustration of Heterogeneous Network Topology.
The notion of heterogeneity in a network can have diﬀerent aspects. On one hand, the network can be considered heterogeneous from the point of view of users who require diﬀerent types of services with a diﬀerent pricing mode. The heterogeneity can also be compared to the services provided to users via each technology. Since the diﬀerent communication standards do not belong to the same generation, networks do not, eventually, support the same classes of services. On the other hand, a heterogeneous network environment is characterized by a complementarity between the available access technologies. For example, as shown in ﬁgure 1.2, Wi-Fi provides better bandwidth quality with limited coverage and

1.2. BACKGROUND: HETEROGENEOUS WIRELESS NETWORKS

17

low cost of service, as opposed to LTE, which oﬀers low bandwidth with a high cost of service and better coverage. Problems in the heterogeneous network environment consist mainly in the interconnection and the mobility management. Interconnection is a set of mechanisms that allow the access nodes of diﬀerent technologies to be interconnected in order to share services and resources while maintaining an independence between the diﬀerent elementary networks.

1.2.2.1 Mobility management and Handover
Mobility is the operation of changing the point of connection in a wireless access network to another one while maintaining the continuity of services. The main objective of mobility management is to maintain information on the position of the mobile terminals and to manage their connections when they move within the coverage areas. Mobility management includes two procedures Sun and Sauvola (2002) :
 Location management: This functionality provides the network with information on the current position of a mobile terminal. It contains two steps, ﬁrst the registration process of the location, where the mobile terminal is authenticated and its position is updated. Then the paging, where the position of the mobile terminals searched during the initialization of a new session.
 Handovers: Handover is the process by which the mobile terminal can maintain communication when it moves from an attachment point (base station) to another attachment point.
Indeed, handover is the process that allows a mobile node to change its attachment point. A mobile node connected to a network can, in order to improve the quality of service, have the need to leave it to connect to another cell, either of the same network or of a new network.

Handover Necessity: Among the causes which are at the origin of a need of Handover we can quote:
 The mobile node leaves the coverage area of the current cell and communicates through a new cell.  The mobile node is highly interfered with on the current cell, hence the need to switch to another
cell (of the same network or a diﬀerent network), where there is less interference.  The number of mobile nodes in a cell is very large so that the bandwidth is insuﬃcient causing a
deterioration in the quality of the service. The mobile can choose to go into neighbouring cells that are less congested.
Handover can take place between two cells of the same technology and will be called Handover Horizontal, or between two cells using diﬀerent technologies, in this case a Vertical Handover. Finally, the combination of these two versions of Handover is called Handover Diagonal to transfer traﬃc from an access point that reaches a connection limit to a diﬀerent technology network

18

CHAPTER 1. NETWORK SELECTION FOR MULTI-HOMED USERS IN HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS: AN OVERVIEW

Handover Procedure

Phase I: Handover initiation and information gathering Handover process must begin when a mobile node needs to leave its point of attachment to the current network to connect to another network where the quality of service will be better. Generally, the reason may be a low power of the signal or a value of one or more quality of service parameters that fall below a certain threshold. During this phase, the mobile node continuously scans the networks in its surroundings by collecting the necessary information from each. This information is essential for the network selection phase. Among these, we ﬁnd those that are connected to the network such as network coverage radius, packet loss rate, bandwidth, Bit Error Ratio (BER), Signal to Interference Ratio (SINR), and so on. Other information is related to the mobile, such as signal strength, battery life, and mobile speed.

Phase II: Destination Network Selection During this phase the information that has been collected from the previous phase will be compiled to arrive at a decision and choose one of several networks available in the environment of the mobile node. The mechanism for selecting a new network is the main subject of this thesis. Classical approaches implements an algorithm based on a single parameter such as : signal strength, , throughput or position ( See section 1.2.2.2).

Phase III: Execution of the Handover In the previous phase, we chose the network to which the mobile node must connect. During this phase, the execution of the disconnection of the links with the old network and the connection with the new network is carried out. This can be done in one of the following four cases:
 Network Controlled Handover Decision (NCHO), usually used by operators to distribute network loads.
 Mobile Controlled Handover Decision (MCHO).  Mobile Assisted Handover (MAHO)  Network Assisted Handover (NAHO).
1.2.2.2 Conventional Cell Selection Techniques
Handover decision helps to determine which access network should be chosen and the handover decision policy represents the inﬂuence of the network on when and where the handover occurs. The traditional handover decision policy is based only on Received Signal Strength (RSS) Kassar et al. (2008) Pahlavan et al. (2000). Conventional algorithms dealing with Network Selection introduce a single decisive parameter, either to trigger the initiation of the handover, or to determine the best interface. These algorithms

1.2. BACKGROUND: HETEROGENEOUS WIRELESS NETWORKS

19

include algorithms based on bandwidth, algorithms based on terminal speed, algorithms based on the direction of the terminal and algorithms based on energy consumption Pahlavan et al. (2000). It is important to note that the RSS-based algorithms cause the ”ping-pong eﬀect” phenomenon due to signal degradation. This phenomenon engenders unnecessary handovers. Thus, RSS should not be the priority criterion in relation to the other criteria for network selection. Given the heterogeneous environment in 4G mobility networks, the handover decision algorithm must combine the RSS parameter and other parameters such as the bandwidth where the network availability time to deliver a given service Zahran and Liang (2005). Bandwidth based vertical handover algorithms consider the bandwidth available to serve the mobile terminal as a primary parameter when selecting the best network interface. The set of approaches proposed in this framework are presented in detail in Yan et al. (2010). In order to have a better decision in the network selection phase, the bandwidth-based vertical handover algorithms generally use the signal strength as a second selection criterion in parallel Liu (2008) Zahran et al. (2006). Diﬀerent techniques Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio (2010a) Kim et al. (1996) have been proposed in the literature to optimize vertical handover by using the speed of the mobile terminal as the main criterion in the decision phase. When the mobile terminal moves at high speed, the probability of blocking users to enter a new cell becomes high. For this reason, speed-based techniques must take into account the diﬀerent speed threshold values at the time of decision. Handover strategies based on the direction of movement of a mobile terminal are useful when the latter moves at high speed. The direction criterion makes it easy to select the best network interface. The strategies that use this criterion make it possible to improve the performance of handover in terms of minimization of number of handovers and also minimization of handover delay. Details of these strategies are provided in Austin and Stuber (1994) Zheng et al. (2004) Tripathi et al. (1998).

1.2.2.3 Vertical handover performance evaluation
The performance of diﬀerent vertical handover algorithms can be evaluated and compared based on the measurement of the following parameters:
 Handover Delay: This parameter represents the elapsed time between the handover initiation phase and the end of the handover execution phase. Moreover, this metric directly inﬂuences the complexity of a handover algorithm. Indeed, a simple decision algorithm can produce a minimum value of this parameter. Generally, real-time applications require a very sensitive value of this metric in order to satisfy user requirements;
 Number of handovers: an eﬀective handover algorithm must avoid unnecessary handovers to maximize network resources and minimize power consumption at the mobile terminal;
 Number of failed handovers: handover failure occurs when the mobile terminal switches to a new target network that does not guarantee suﬃcient resources for the terminal. This failure is also

20

CHAPTER 1. NETWORK SELECTION FOR MULTI-HOMED USERS IN HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS: AN OVERVIEW

possible when the terminal moves outside the coverage of the target network before the vertical handover process is completed. This parameter directly inﬂuences the QoS of the current session;
 Quality of service: it is important that the handover algorithm optimizes the performance of QoS parameters such as throughput, delay, jitter, loss rate, etc.

1.3 Conclusion
Wireless network technologies are applied in diﬀerent ﬁelds such as industry and science. In this chapter we have presented the diﬀerent mobile communications standards with their heterogeneous performance and capabilities. We have also found that these diﬀerent standards constitute a heterogeneous environment for the user. The integration of various wireless networking technologies has become necessary to provide seamless interoperability for users. Vertical handover has been proposed as an eﬀective solution to integrate existing technologies in next-generation networks while ensuring the ABC paradigm. We have also described the process of vertical handover, the diﬀerent phases that constitute this process, as well as the parameters involved in the decision-making phase of the handover. Seamless Network Selection is a very complex problem, since it must take account of several factors such as the mobility of the mobile terminal, the selection criteria and the type of services. To address this problem, several algorithms are proposed in the literature in recent years. According to the criteria used and the mathematical models that exploit these criteria, there are four main propositions in the literature. We chose to optimize the network selection phase, which represents the most important phase in the handover process.
The literature review of the most reputed schemes are outlined in the next chapter.

2.1 Introduction
In the previous chapter, (section 1.2.2.2), we have come to the conclusion that single-parameter approaches do not follow the evolution of wireless networks. Thus, in this chapter, we present the state of the art of the main approaches that are developed and proposed to optimize vertical handover using multi criteria concept.

alternative. It is an outstanding revolution in the world of mobile communication, by providing an enhanced QoE for mobile users of wireless technologies.

In the framework of VH, Ahuja et al. (2014a) suggested an algorithm for vertical handover depend on ”averaged received signal strength, outage probability and distance”. Not to mention that authors improved their work in Ahuja et al. (2014b), in the way of proposing a new scheme using ”signal strength, available bit rate, signal to noise ratio, achievable throughput, bit error rate and outage probability metrics” as metrics of comparison. Authors mixed excerpt metrics with ”Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)” for a dynamic weight computation. In the context of type of metrics used, a vertical handover decision that relies on ”coverage area” of the network and ”the velocity” of the mobile user was proposed by Jain and Tokekar (2015). Moreover, Yang and Tseng (2013) proposed a handover that considers two actions: ”attributes rating and network ranking”. Authors related their scheme to the classical ”signal based handover model” and certainly proved a lowest packet drop ratio and higher average throughput. In Jaraiz-Simon et al. (2015), authors explained that a determined set of weights produces certain quality or merit degree for each network; these merit values change if we consider another set of weights. The goal is to obtain the best merit value, which will correspond to the selected network for the VH decision phase. Accordingly, the more combinations of weights, the more possibilities to get better merit values we will have.

Recent scientiﬁc researches Dealt with Multi Criteria problems in diﬀerent domains. Authors of Moghaddam (2015) developed a fuzzy multi-objective mathematical model to identify and rank the candidate suppliers. Whereas, the authors of Memon et al. (2015) applied the combination of grey system theory and uncertainty theory which neither requires any probability distribution nor fuzzy membership function to solve Supplier selection problem. In Abdollahi et al. (2015), Authors presented a framework for supplier selection based on product-related and organization-related characteristics of the suppliers to be more competitive in the market and ﬂexible to overcome probable changes in demands, supplies etc. Supplier selection problem was solved by the authors using a combination of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods. A model for ranking the suppliers for the automotive industry in Pakistan was proposed in Dweiri et al. (2016), the weights aﬀecting supplier selection could be qualitative or quantitative. There are many qualitative concerns when assessing the factors critical to supplier selection. Some of the factors can be diﬃcult to quantify. Therefore, an hybrid techniques such as fuzzy AHP can be used to address this gap.

Accordingly, ”Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)” is one of the best network selection methods that can used for Vertical Handover Decision (VHD) in heterogeneous wireless networks. It presents many assets, conspicuously, its simplicity of implementation, however, the growing number of users make it incompetent considering the time of the decision when is more signiﬁcant particularly for real-time applications. Another omission of such decision is the human interference at the moment of initiation of the performance indicators. As an example, AHP lacks of objectivity of judgement. In Goyal and Kaushal

2.2. RELATED WORKS ON MULTI CRITERIA NETWORK SELECTION APPROACHES

(2016), authors explain that a deﬁned set of weights yields a speciﬁc merits for candidate networks; these merit estimations vary with the use of another collection of weights. The goal is to acquire the best merit that ﬁt the best elected network during the vertical handover decision phase.

2.2.1.2 Network Selection Based On Utility Function and Matching Game
One of the challenges involved in the context of next generation networks is the development of solutions that consider several requirements in order to select the best network whenever it is needed to evaluate the transition of the mobile device between diﬀerent networks.
There have been many works dealing with the Network Selection problem in diﬀerent ways. Kassar et al. (2008) compared traditional handover decision strategies (RSSbased), and concluded that they are not good enough to make a vertical handover decision. They do not take into account the current context or user preferences. Therefore, vertical handover decision strategy involves complicated considerations and compromises. Authors of Wang and Kuo (2013) studied the most important mathematical theories used for modelling the network selection problem in the literature. Authors compared the schemes of various mathematical theories in an uniﬁed scenario and discuss the ways to beneﬁt from combining multiple algorithms together. As a matter of fact, Lopez-Benitez and Gozalvez (2011) proposed and optimized a common radio resource management techniques designed to eﬃciently distribute traﬃc among the available radio access technologies while providing adequate quality of service levels under heterogeneous traﬃc scenarios. Ma and Ma (2009) also investigated in vertical handover in heterogeneous wireless networks. authors proposed a QoS-based vertical handover scheme for WLAN and WiMAX networks in order to provide always best service to users. Furthermore, authors of Mansouri et al. (2015) proposed a scheduling algorithm for the same cited goals, they proposed solution for scheduling packets while maintaining performance in wireless networks. The scheduling scheme is based on transmission link’s condition from the media independent handover (MIH) protocol, type of call and classes of service. In a similar context, Some researchers have been using utility function to select the best candidate network. Utility function refers to the satisfaction that a good or service provides to the decision maker. Indeed, Kosmides et al. (2014) allocated terminals to the most appropriate network by jointly examining both user’s and provider’s preferences. Authors introduced three utility-based optimization functions based on the type of application that users request. In the same way, Chamodrakas and Martakos (2011) presented a method that takes into account user preferences, network conditions, QoS and energy consumption requirements in order to select the optimal network which achieves the best balance between performance and energy consumption. The proposed network selection method incorporates the use of parametrized utility functions in order to model diverse QoS elasticities of diﬀerent applications. Pirmez et al. (2010) presented a selection mechanism that prioritizes networks with higher relevance to the application and lower energy consumption based on utility function. Wu and Du (2015) proposed a network selection scheme based on a utility function that take user’s QoS demands, preferences and

24

channel state information (CSI) into account.

A tremendous endeavours have been achieved recently in the ﬁeld of wireless networks to improve QoS and QoE while meeting the growing demand for high data rates and coverage of mobile users.

For bringing in the beneﬁts of wireless networks coexistence, numerous approaches have been addressed such as resource management, user association and access point selection Anpalagan (2015), Lopez-Perez et al. (2011), De La Roche et al. (2010), Ashraf et al. (2016) and Beltran et al. (2016) using matching game theory, a winning the 2012 Nobel Prize, which provides a mathematically tractable method for personnel assignment problem in two distinct sets. Moghaddam and Nof (2017) deﬁned Best Matching as the process of ﬁnding the best match between the elements of two or more sets, considering certain conditions and criteria. In wireless communications context, it is essentially based on the link of user equipments (UEs) with diﬀerent available Access Points (AP). These links, in turn, deﬁne their predilection or preferences to one another under peculiar criteria. There are some surveys in the literature that introduce matching theory applied to wireless communications Xu and Li (2011),Gu et al. (2015). Gu et al. (2015) introduced general concepts of matching theory and an eﬃcient algorithm, known as the Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm, which was developed by Gale and Shapley (1962), to ﬁnd a matching between mobile users and access points. DA is an iterative procedure, in which players in one set make proposals to the other set, whose players, in turn, decide to accept or reject these proposals, respecting their quota. This algorithm has been used diﬀerently in more than one work to solve network selection problem Kazmi et al. (2016),Shao et al. (2016) and Zeng et al. (2016). Matching theory has loomed as an up-and-coming approach for wireless resource management which can subdue some drawbacks of previous approaches such as such as Utility Function, Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) and Fuzzy logic Gu et al. (2015). In the same context, authors in Bayat et al. (2016) described wireless networks as a diverse interacting selﬁsh and rational agents with a natural propensity to solicit their maximum beneﬁt from the network without caring about other agents, claiming that, Game theory which has been widely used in open literature to facilitate autonomous network management and dynamic resource allocation can not deal with complex networks, in which, diﬀerent types of agents with various characteristics and requirements want to interact with each other, and conventional game theoretical models can hardly be utilized. In Gu et al. (2016), authors claimed that the matching approach can be applied to multiple wireless resource allocation problems in the sense that it has a convenient models for characterizing interactions between the heterogeneous players. In addition, it is able to describe properly the ”preferences” that can interpret the complex system constraints. It oﬀers achievable solutions that reﬂect diﬀerent system objectives, such as stability and ﬁnally, it provides eﬃcient algorithms for distributed implementations. The theory of games is a mathematical tool developed mainly for the study of the interactions between several agents (individuals, groups, companies, etc.) Fudenberg and Tirole (1991). Game theory provides mathematical approaches to structuring, analyzing and understanding problems that require decision-making. The ﬁeld of application of gaming theory has invaded several ﬁelds such as war, biology, engineering, transport, networks / telecommunications, etc. In the context of

heterogeneous networks, several works are proposed in the literature to optimize the decision of handover Trestian et al. (2012b). Authors Trestian et al. (2012b) presented an overview of the work that is published to overcome the problems and challenges of network selection in 4G. The authors aim to familiarize the researchers with the concept of the selection of the network and also with the diﬀerent algorithms of the theory of games that are used in the literature to model the problem of the network selection. For the same reason, the authors propose a complete classiﬁcation concerning the diﬀerent approaches based on the theory of games as well as their uses to attack the problem of network selection. This classiﬁcation regroups the algorithms of the handover in three categories according to the interactions of the actors intervening in the game: users vs. Users, networks vs. Networks and users vs. Networks. Finally, the authors gave a comparison and an analysis between the diﬀerent solutions developed to solve the problem of network selection based on the theory of games.

2.2.2 Network Selection Schemes: Synthesis and Comparison

This section provides a comparison and synthesis of the handover algorithms that are discussed in this chapter. Because network selection is the most important phase during vertical handover, the evaluation and comparison between the diﬀerent vertical handover approaches focus mainly on this phase. Network performance, user satisfaction, user preferences, eﬃciency, complexity, ﬂexibility and reliability for all handover algorithms should be considered to compare and evaluate approaches to vertical handover. Thus, table 2.1 presents comparison is based on evaluation parameters such as: multi-criteria choice, user preferences, eﬃciency, ﬂexibility, complexity and type of services supported.

Table 2.1: Comparison of Diﬀerent Network Selection Approaches. Yan et al. (2010)

RSS MADM Utility Function Fuzzy Logic Matching Theory

Multi-Criteria No Yes Yes Yes Yes

User Preferences No Medium High Medium-High High

Eeﬃciency Low High High High High

Flexibility Low Medium Medium High Medium

Complexity Low Medium Medium High High

Multi-Service No Yes Yes Yes Yes

According to this comparison, the network selection algorithms which are proposed despite their developed aspects present some disadvantages and certain limits. In terms of complexity, conventional algorithms are generally the simplest to implement among all categories since they mainly use a single criterion such as RSS, bandwidth, and so on. The complexity increases with the MADM methods which require not only a set of criteria but also the fact that the latter must be standardized.
Moreover, the use of artiﬁcial intelligence and hybrid algorithms have the disadvantage of being too complex to implement. In terms of reliability, handover algorithms that are based on artiﬁcial intelligence and the MADM approach are considered to be the most reliable algorithms among all existing handover approaches. They can provide precise solutions by taking into account several decision factors in the network selection process. In terms of services, conventional algorithms are not applicable for real-time

transmission. On the other hand, methods based on Artiﬁcial Intelligence and the MADM approach can support all classes of services.

2.3 Related works on 5G V2X scenarios
2.3.1 Heterogeneous Networking in 5G for V2X Scenarios
The evolution towards future Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by enabling telematics services for vehicular applications. Under this premise, numerous research and development projects dealing with the topic of V2X mobile communication have been conducted from both industry and academia within the past decade Stu¨bing et al. (2010). Most of the previous work in this ﬁeld aims at understanding the eﬀects of mobility on communication processes taking place on the physical layer as well as on system level for the dedicated IEEE 802.11p standard.
In order to overcome the known issues in an adequate manner,the incorporation of LTE as a 4G cellular network into the communication is considered. Due to its inherent characteristics, e.g. low achievable end-to-end latency between users and wide area coverage, the use of LTE for V2X communication can be especially beneﬁcial in certain situations where IEEE 802.11p suﬀers from low signal to noise ratio (SNR), e.g. in urban intersections with obstructed line-of-sight M¨oller et al. (2014). Taking this approach one step further, also combining IEEE 802.11p and LTE to a hybrid communication system is possible. This would enable to use either only one radio access technology (RAT) or both simultaneously to achieve the reliable dissemination of information between vehicles and traﬃc infrastructure, depending on the individual street- and telephone traﬃc as well as propagation conditions. The design of such a hybrid system architecture requires the detailed evaluation of individual system performances in speciﬁc situations with respect to both vehicular applications and their requirements as well as boundary conditions such as network load and radio propagation. Sensible metrics need to be derived as input for involved protocols, e.g. to trigger inter-system handovers Mir and Filali (2014b), Mir and Filali (2014a). Seo et al. (2016) discussed how LTE systems are evolving in order to support V2X services. Basic safety services such as collision warning as well as convenience services such as traﬃc ﬂow optimization are identiﬁed as the ﬁrst step of LTE-based V2X services. Those services can be provided in multiple operation scenarios using the D2D interface, the cellular interface, or their combination. The main challenges identiﬁed in supporting V2X services are high mobility and dense population of UEs, and LTE systems need to be enhanced so that the service requirements can be fulﬁlled in such a vehicular communication environment. Levering the spectrally eﬃcient air interface, cost-eﬀective network deployment, and the versatile nature of supporting diﬀerent communication types, LTE systems along with proper enhancements can be a cost-eﬀective enabler of V2X services. Furthermore, 3GPP has also started to discuss more advanced services of connected cars as the second step, and the related speciﬁcation work is expected to continue

2.3. RELATED WORKS ON 5G V2X SCENARIOS

27

for further LTE evolution and the new air interface design for 5G communications.

V2X communications concern the communication of information between fast moving vehicles with relative velocities that can exceed 300 km/h in some cases (or moving in opposite directions). The V2X applications in the present speciﬁcation of the 3GPP 3rd Generation Partnership Project (2017b), as for LTE V2X, the essential use cases identiﬁed are as follows 3rd Generation Partnership Project (2015):

 Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V): expect UEs that are in proximity of each other to exchange V2V application information. The UE supporting V2V applications transmits messages containing V2V application information (e.g. location, dynamics, and attributes).
 Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I): The UE supporting V2I applications transmits messages containing V2I application information to a relevant application server. This latter transmits messages containing V2I application information to one or more UEs supporting V2I applications in a particular geographic area. There can be multiple application servers serving overlapping areas, providing the same or diﬀerent applications. It covers communication between a vehicle and a roadside unit.
 Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P): Expect UEs that are in proximity of each other to exchange V2P application information. It is expected also that V2P application information can be transmitted either by a UE supporting V2X application in a vehicle (e.g., warning to pedestrian), or by a UE supporting V2X application associated with a vulnerable road user (e.g., warning to vehicle). It covers communication between a vehicle and a device carried by an individual (e.g. hand-held terminal carried by a pedestrian, cyclist, driver or passenger).

V2X applications have stringent requirements on high reliability and low latency. In the road safety and traﬃc eﬃciency applications, information is exchanged between traﬃc actors using V2V, V2P or V2I communications.
The 3GPP also identiﬁed diﬀerent use cases and potential service requirements to enhance support for V2X service. Diﬀerent V2X scenarios require the transport of V2X messages with diﬀerent performance requirements for the 3GPP system. This Technical Speciﬁcation speciﬁes service requirements to enhance 3GPP support for V2X scenarios in the following areas, Vehicle Platooning, Advanced Driving, Extended Sensors and Remote Driving 3rd Generation Partnership Project (2017a) 3rd Generation Partnership Project (2016):

 Vehicles Platooning enables the vehicles to dynamically form a platoon travelling together. All the UEs in the platoon obtain information from the leading vehicle to manage this platoon. These information allow the vehicles to drive closer (short time or distance inter-vehicle gap) than normal in a coordinated manner, going to the same direction and travelling together. These are expected to be a set of sophisticated application.

28

CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW

 Extended Sensors enables the exchange of raw or processed data gathered through local sensors or live video images among vehicles, road site units, devices’ of pedestrian and V2X application servers. The vehicles can increase the perception of their environment beyond of what their own sensors can detect and have have a more broad and holistic view of the local situation. High data rate is one of the key characteristics.
 Advanced driving enables semi-automated or full-automated driving. Longer inter-vehicle distance is assumed. Each vehicle and/or Road Side Unit (RSU) shares its own perception data obtained from its local sensors with vehicles in proximity and that allows vehicles to synchronize and coordinate their trajectories or manoeuvres. Each vehicle shares its driving intention with vehicles in proximity, too. The beneﬁts of this use case group are safer travelling, collision avoidance, and improved traﬃc eﬃciency.
 Remote Driving enables a remote driver or a V2X application to operate a remote vehicle for those passengers who cannot drive by themselves or remote vehicles located in dangerous environments. For a case where variation is limited and routes are predictable, such as public transportation, driving based on cloud computing can be used. Also, access to cloud-based back-end service platform can be considered for this use case group. High reliability and short low latency are the main requirements.

It should be noted that there are various use case related variables involved in these scenarios (e.g. maximum tolerable latency, minimum application layer message reception reliability). These parameters need to be managed as designing the system in such a way as to meet all of the most stringent criteria places an unnecessary burden on the system. Some of these parameters are as follow:

 End-to-end latency: Time it takes to transfer a given piece of information from a source to a destination, measured at the application level, from the moment it is transmitted by the source to the moment it is received at the destination.
 Reliability (%): The success probability of transmitting X bytes within a certain delay.
 Data rate: The speed at which data is transferred from source to destination.

Discussion on the evolution of LTE-Advanced in Rel-14 is already occurring. It is expected that Rel-14 would introduce technologies for latency reduction, which is one of the most important aspects for improving the user experience but has not been improved much since the introduction of LTE. Technologies for V2X such as Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), and Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) have recently attracted signiﬁcant attention from the cellular industry as another opportunity for LTEAdvanced technologies to be extended to support vertical industries, and are expected to be speciﬁed in Rel-14. As a technology for further improving spectral eﬃciency by allowing non-orthogonal downlink

2.4. CONCLUSION

29

transmissions within a cell, the enhancement for downlink multi-user transmission using superposition coding was studied during Rel-13 for potential speciﬁcation work in Rel-14 Lee et al. (2016).

The main factor contributing to the delay increase, in such environment is the network handover decision which increase drastically the time and latency of the interface between source and target cell. Consequently, for high-mobility vehicles, The shorter the handover time, the better. Moreover, various issues are present in the current vertical handover management schemes such as inappropriate handover triggering, high handover delay, wrong network selection, etc.

2.4 Conclusion
These works have brought us, as ﬁrst contribution, to investigate in the framework of multi criteria prominent MADM methods, namely, MEW, SAW, TOPSIS, VIKOR and AHP and examine the impact of their combination as vertical handover schemes in environment with recent technologies. Matching game theory works have exhorted us to use a matching theoretic approach to ﬁnd the most suitable network to mobile users regarding the type of application they use. Although gaming theory is widely used for load distribution, it does not prove to be appropriate for the ABC paradigm. Indeed, with the theory of games, networks (players in a game) select their appropriate services. For the ”ABC” concept, the services must select their best network. Therefore, as a contribution, we used matching theory to ensure load balancing in our system model. Finally, in order to address the aforementioned issues related to vehicular environments, we applied the handover management schemes that provide a cooperative awareness of diﬀerent use cases in heterogeneous vehicular networks in furtherance of enabling more intelligent services for end-users in V2X scenarios.

3.1 Introduction
In this chapter, we tackle the network selection issue levering a combination of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods to ensure that appropriate network is selected for a certain type of traﬃc and considering a number of QoS metrics that due to their interdependency, a weight distribution phase is required. To ascertain thoroughly the weights of QoS metrics impacting the decision for each application, AHP is generally applied. But its classical form comes with biased rules that are dealt with through an enhanced version FAHP (Fuzzy AHP) that has proven its performance when combined with the other well reputed ranking methods, namely: MEW,SAW,TOPSIS and VIKOR.
3.2 MADM-based Network Selection Schemes
We present in this section the mathematical modelling of MADM-based Network selection strategies.

CHAPTER 3. A MULTI-CRITERIA NETWORK SELECTION APPROACH IN HETEROGENEOUS ENVIRONMENT USING MADM

3.2.1 Principle of MADM

For Network Selection, classical MADM approach consists in choosing the best network from available networks considering multiple attributes. The vertical handover decision problem can be formulated as a matrix form Q, where each row i corresponds to the candidate network and each column j corresponds to an attribute. The matrix of N alternative networks is settled conforming to M attributes.

3.2.2 Normalization Methods
As all MADM methods grant the evaluated criteria to be expressed in diﬀerent measurement units, it is necessary to convert them into normalized values.

3.2.2.1 The Euclidean Normalization Technique

This technique has the advantage of normalizing the attributes on diﬀerent units in a very simple way

Yoon and Hwang (1995). Thus, considering the matrix above, the normalized values using the Euclidean

normalization technique are:

nij =

qij , j = 1, ..., M
i=N
qi2j
i=1

(3.1)

3.2.2.2 The Normalization by Sum Technique

This procedure consists in dividing the value qij of the attribute for each alternative by the sum of the

values of all the alternatives corresponding to this attribute. The normalized value nij is obtained as

follows:

nij

=

qij
i=N

, j = 1, ..., M

qij

i=1

(3.2)

Finally, the choice of the proper technique of normalization to be used for such a MADM Method remains

open. Or, there is no speciﬁcation made for response in light of the diversity of MADM methods in the

literature.

3.2.3 MADM Methods

This section presents the diﬀerent algorithms that can be used as the core of network selection. In order to guarantee continuity and quality of service during the transfer of a communication, the design and modelling of an intelligent solution for the vertical handover decision is required. This solution allows users to select the optimal network while maintaining the ABC principle. Several algorithms, based on the MADM approach have been proposed to solve the problem of network selection. These algorithms are applied mainly to classify network alternatives. In the remainder of this section, we present a detailed description of the main steps of each MADM methods AHP, FAHP, TOPSIS, VIKOR, MEW and SAW.

3.2.3.1 Analytical Hierarchy Process: AHP

AHP was proposed by Saaty (1987) for ”decision-making in multi-criteria problems, they introduced it as a method of measurement with ratio scales, AHP allows comparison and a choice of pre-set options. It is based on the comparison of pairs of options and criteria”. A AHP problem is organized in a tiered form; the diﬀerent rows have diﬀerent items. The signiﬁcance of an item (or ”scores of alternatives”) is calculated eventually under the aegis of a succession of comparative statements. Indeed, we have to specify the predilections by contrasting all items in each row with respect to above row items. The calculation of the importance of an item requires deal with to a series of comparisons of two elements (or metrics). Generally, the comparison’s purpose is to ascertain which item answers the more the option’s requirements. If quantitative data is not available, a qualitative judgement can be used for a pair wise comparison. This qualitative pairwise comparison follows the importance scale suggested by Saaty (1987) as shown in table 3.1.

Table 3.1: Criteria importance scale in pairwise comparison.

According to Kubler et al. (2016), if A is a pairwise comparison matrix as formalized in Eq. 3.3, where aij | (i, j ∈ N ) is supposed to reﬂect how many more times item/criterion i is preferred to item/criterion

AHP generates weights w that express the signiﬁcance of the quality of service metrics regarding a

criterion. As a deduction, vectors wj > 0 serves as the signiﬁcance of the jth metric as

j=M j=1

wj

=

1.

The next step is to derive the weights, by solving the eigenvector method (EM) proposed by Saaty

(1977) and then normalizing the result. EM derives the priorities w1, w2, . . ., wn of comparable metrics:

metric1, metric2, . . ., metricn as the solution of the right eigenvector problem for the corresponding

pairwise comparison matrix Anxn with λmax as the maximal eigenvalue.

Thereby, the weights are produced based upon certain criterion. The result weights are used for the decision.

3.2.3.2 Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process: FAHP
Fuzzy set approach purpose is to cut oﬀ the hazy analogy assessments by the use of fuzzy numbers. FAHP engenders the fuzzy signiﬁcance of a combination of two items in the same row. The fuzzy extension is required because the basic AHP misses the important aspect of tackling the high degree in vagueness of personal subjective judgements and preferences Tyagi et al. (2017), as authors claimed, FAHP is relevant to solve the problem at hand considering multi-criteria structure and vagueness in real environment. This systematic approach basically integrates two fundamentally distinct concepts, the fuzzy set theory and the AHP. The advantage of fuzzy set theory is in dealing with the ambiguity intrinsic to the decisionmaking problems and the ability to deﬁne vague data using classes and grouping with boundaries Nguyen and Gordon-Brown (2012).

Fuzzy Set Theory and Fuzzy Numbers : Zadeh (1965) explained that the focal point of the fuzzy sets theory is its facility to represent an ambiguous data in a innate form. It has been worn for

3.2. MADM-BASED NETWORK SELECTION SCHEMES

35

modelling complex systems that can be controlled by humans but are severe to determine fairly and without bias which is the case of AHP. The fundamental feature of fuzziness is the grouping of criteria into a set of collections without sharply deﬁne the outer limits. The reason for the success of fuzzy logic in many applications is its capacity to accredit degree of membership between 0 and 1 using ”Linguistic terms”, expressed by membership functions and valued in ”the real unit interval”, which convert the ambiguity of human conclusions in a particular problem.

In the existing researches, the triangular fuzzy numbers (TFN) are commonly exploited to deﬁne the ambiguity of the metric studied all along the investigation. A TFN is a particular category of fuzzy numbers, its membership is deﬁned by (l, m, u) three crisp numbers as: (l ≤ m ≤ u), where l is ”the lower limit value”, m is ”the most propitious value” and u is ”the upper limit value” presented in ﬁgure 3.1. When l = m = u, fuzzy number become a real number. A TFN can be deﬁned as:

Hence, fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices can be built up (Eq. 3.6) as the case of AHP pairwise comparison model, in a fuzzy form by using TFNs as instead of crisp numbers:

ai,j = (li,j , mi,j , ui,j ) and a−i,j1 = (1/ui,j , 1/mi,j , 1/li,j ).

ai,j, i, j ∈ 1, 2, . . . , n is supposed to reveal how many more times criterion i is preferred to criterion j with a certain level of ambiguity and/or equivocalness in each type of traﬃc. The fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices follow the importance scale suggested by Bu¨yu¨k¨ozkan et al. (2008) and recapped in table 3.2.

Resultantly, the fuzzy weight vectors are computed for all alternatives by applying the ”Extent Analysis Method” Chang (1996) which derives crisp weights from a fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices.
3.2.3.3 Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution: TOPSIS
The selected network is the one that is abutting to the positive ideal network and distant from the negative ideal solution. These networks are determined as networks with the maximum and minimum values for each QoS metrics. It should be mentioned that for a metric of performance the best value is the largest and for a cost metric the best value is the lowest. The steps of TOPSIS process are cited in Vega et al. (2014):

Step 1 Compute the weighted decision matrix: vij = wij · nij

Step 2 Deﬁne the ”positive ideal” and ”negative ideal” networks given by:

A+

Step 4 Compute the ratio closeness Ri of network i to the ideal and anti-ideal solutions by:

(3.10)

Such as Ri is better when converging 0; Ri ∈ [0, 1].

3.2.3.4 VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje: VIKOR
The VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje ”(VIKOR; that means multi-criteria optimization and compromise solution)”. It was elaborated for multi-criteria optimization of intricate systems Opricovic (1998) and Tzeng and Huang (2011). VIKOR is based on listing and choosing from a batch of available networks in consideration of an inconsistent metrics. It proposes the multi-criteria ranking key based on the speciﬁc measure of ”closeness” to the ”ideal” solution. The concept of VIKOR is hinged on ﬁguring out the compromise solution from ranking the alternatives regarding the weight coherence intervals which depend on the preference of the compromise solution provided with the original weights. The following steps are mandatory for VIKOR:

Step 1 For each metric j = 1, 2, ..., M , deﬁne the best and worst values given by:

fj+

Step 3 Afterwards, the values of Qi for i = 1, 2, ..., N are calculated as:

Qi = β

Si − S+ Si − S−

+ (1 − β)

Ri − R+ Ri − R−

Where:

S+ = min Si, S− = max Si

i=1,2,...,N

i=1,2,...,N

(3.15)

R+ = min Ri, R− = max Ri

i=1,2,...,N

i=1,2,...,N

The coeﬃcient β , 0 ≤ β ≤ 1 is called the weight of the approach deﬁned as ”the majority of criteria” (or ”the maximum group utility”). Here, we set β = 0.5 since we consider the batch of metrics for all networks.

Step 4 Given the values for Q, for all i = 1, 2, ..., N , the available networks can be sorted in ascending order. The selected network V IKOR is :

V IKOR = arg( min Qi)
i=1,2,...,N

(3.16)

3.2.3.5 Multiplicative Exponent Weighting: MEW

The tally SMEW of a candidate network i is deﬁned by the compromised product of the multiplication

of the metrics:

M

SMEW =

nwijj

j=1

(3.17)

It should be noted that in the previous equation, wj is a positive exponent nwijj for metrics of performance , and a negative exponent n−ijwj for metrics of cost. Whereas the overall score of a network produced by
MEW bounded above, it is suitable to compare each network vector with the score of a positive ideal

network A+ which is deﬁned by the ﬁrst part of equation (4.7). The proportion Ri of network i regarding

the positive ideal network is computed by:

Ri =

M j=1

nwijj

M j=1

(n∗ij

)wj

(3.18)

Such asRi ∈ [0, 1]. Duly, the elected network according to MEW is : AMEW = maxi(Ri)

3.2.3.6 Simple Additive Weighting: SAW

SAW is also noted as ”the weighted sum method” and it is the most commonly used MADM method Hwang and Yoon (1981). The main purpose of SAW is to bring in a weighted worth of the performances of the candidate networks. Thusly, the outright tally of a candidate network SSAW is deﬁned by the weighted sum of all metrics. It is obtained by summing the performances nij the normalized metric multiplied by the importance wj of the metric Qj as follow:

M
SSAW = wj · nij
j=1

(3.19)

Such as: wj is the weight vector. nij is the value of normalized metric j of network i. N and M are respectively the number of alternatives and the number of criterion of each alternative.

3.3 Proposed Network Selection Framework System Model
The purview of our work is primarily in handover decision phase, as mentioned in the previous section. The contribution, in this chapter, consists of a handover decision phase, where Users must choose the best network from available networks regarding the decision metrics. Multifarious MADM methods have been suggested in the literature for vertical handover decision, methods such as SAW, VIKOR, MEW, TOPSIS or AHP.
We modelled the decision into two phases namely, the weighting and the ranking of available networks. Thus, the algorithms, in the MADM approach, are used in two ways:
 The weighting algorithms that are used to assign weights for criteria such as AHP, FAHP, etc.  The ranking algorithms that are applied to classify the alternatives according to their performance
as SAW, VIKOR, MEW and TOPSIS.
The goal of this contribution is to compare the impact of diﬀerent multi-criteria vertical handover schemes on the QoS in diﬀerent traﬃc scenarios. As disclosed in ﬁgure 3.2, QoS metric measurement can be provided to the system by simulation or the real network in real time. Afterwards, the pairwise comparison processes related to AHP method are applied according to each QoS class: Conversational ”Conv”, Streaming ”Strea”, Interactive ”Inter” and Background ”Back”. The Weight Distribution Algorithm (AHP or FAHP) is used eventually to compute the weight vectors in order to obtain the relative importance of each metric considering Bit Error Rate ”Ber”, Jitter ”J”, Delay ”D” and Throughput ”T” of the participating access networks to make the handover decisions. Thereupon, SAW, VIKOR, MEW and TOPSIS are applied to the weighted matrices (or fuzzy weighted matrices) to attain the outright

decision for each method. Each handover decision is made in real-time and repeatedly, in our case the process is repeated every 5 seconds.

Figure 3.2: MADM-based Algorithm Block
3.3.1 Weighting Distribution Phase
The weighting of the criteria is an important step in the decision-making process. In this phase, decision makers express their preferences between the criteria by weighting or the relative weight they attribute to each criterion. Weight therefore expresses the importance given by a decision-maker to a criterion. There are diﬀerent weighting methods to calculate the weight of each criterion. These methods can be categorized into two categories. The ﬁrst category represents subjective weighting methods. The subjective determination of weights leads to several sets of weights that reﬂect diﬀerent scales of values and opinions that may be divergent. Among the methods of this category, we cite AHP and FAHP. The second category represents the objective weighting in which decision makers do not intervene to assign weights. The degree of importance of each criterion is calculated according to the numerical measures of the set of criteria. This category contains methods such as entropy, random weighting, and genetic algorithms.
3.3.1.1 Weighting Distribution by AHP (Drissi and Oumsis, 2015a)
Algorithm steps Weight computing requires answering to a sequence of comparisons between a pair metrics. The common way to ask a question is to consider two elements, and ﬁnd out which one satisﬁes the criterion more. The answers are given by using the fundamental 1-9 AHP scale Saaty (1987) in Table 3.1 presented in section 3.2.3.1. Table 3.3 presents the answers of the questions asked about the relative importance between each pair of metric Bit Error Rate (BER), Jitter (J), Delay (D) and Throughput (T) , for example, in Conversational Class, the ﬁrst comparison is (BER, Jitter), the question is : How much more is BER preferred over Jitter in conversational Class? Indeed, Jitter is 7 times more important

than BER, so the value in matrix is 1/7, and accordingly 7 is put in the opposite side (symmetrical to the diagonal).

In Stevens-Navarro and Wong (2006) , authors explained that if C is deﬁned as an AHP comparison matrix as in Table 3.11, then by solving the system : U.w = nmax (where nmax is the largest eigenvalue of U ), the priority or importance vector w can be obtained. Thus, the weights rely on the QoS prerequisite of the traﬃc classes. We use the eigenvector method used by the AHP to ﬁgure out the weights presented in Table 3.4.

AHP critics AHP is easy to implement. Moreover, it has the advantage of modelling the problem of decision by a hierarchical structure. Moreover, it uses a semantic scale to express the preferences of the decision-maker. However, AHP has been the subject of several criticisms:
 It requires dependency between elements of the same hierarchical level.  A large number of elements in the decision problem increases the number of paired comparisons.  The problem of reversal of rank or what is also called an anomaly of the ranking (two actions may
have their order of priority reversed following a modiﬁcation (addition or deletion of one or more actions) of all the actions  The association of a numerical scale with the semantic scale is restrictive, it introduces imprecise numerical values

42

CHAPTER 3. A MULTI-CRITERIA NETWORK SELECTION APPROACH IN HETEROGENEOUS ENVIRONMENT USING MADM

In order to avoid these various limitations, AHP method has to be the subject of several extensions to be considered in the expression of judgements and adapted to network selection.

3.3.1.2 Weighting Distribution by Fuzzy AHP (Drissi et al., 2016b)

Algorithm steps To compare the FAHP with our previous work Drissi and Oumsis (2015a), we translated the weights of the previous work regarding the Triangular Fuzzy Conversion Scale of Bu¨yu¨k¨ozkan et al. (2008), shown in Table 3.2 presented in section 3.2.3.2. Hence we generated the fuzzy relative importance for each class of traﬃc namely: Conversational (Conv), Streaming (Strea), Interactive (Inter) and Background (Back) and for each metric (BER), Jitter (J), Delay (D) and Throughput (T) presented in Table 3.5.

We reviewed the mathematical logic of fuzzy AHP of Chang Chang (1996) since it has a wide inﬂuence on the theories and applications of fuzzy AHP used in many recent researches. Accordingly, we calculated the fuzzy weighted importance of each class of traﬃc using the Extent Analysis Method, the value of fuzzy synthetic extent with respect to the ith object is deﬁned in eq.3.20:

The possibility of Si ≥ Sj is deﬁned as V (Si ≥ Sj) = SU Px≥y [min(Si(x), Sj(y))], x and y are the values on the axis of the membership function of each criterion as shown in ﬁgure 3.3. This expression can be

(3.22)

In this case the weight vector is given by : W = (w (A1), w (A2)...w (Am) where Ai(i = 1, 2, ..., m) are m attributes. Via normalization, we get the normalized weight vectors, where W is a non-fuzzy number.

W = (w(A1), w(A2)...w(Am))T

(3.23)

Finally, the Fuzzy AHP method is applied for the four classes of QoS and the weights are correspondingly generated given in table 3.6.

CHAPTER 3. A MULTI-CRITERIA NETWORK SELECTION APPROACH IN HETEROGENEOUS ENVIRONMENT USING MADM

Using AHP and FAHP weights, the available networks are ranked by SAW, VIKOR, MEW and TOPSIS.

FAHP critics Similar to AHP, FAHP has the same limitations as AHP except that it is able to associate a numeric scale with that semantic in an eﬃcient and more neutral way. The inaccuracy caused by the decisions of the decision maker on the preferences between the alternative networks in AHP is avoided if it is combined with fuzzy logic.

3.4 Conclusion
In order to reach the required QoS for all types of traﬃc and avoid service discontinuity in heterogeneous networks, we implemented, in this chapter, a Multi-Criteria Decision Framework for Network Selection for an ubiquitous and real time network selection based on AHP and FAHP methods coupled with four ranking Methods, i.e. TOPSIS, VIKOR, MEW and SAW to prove the eﬀectiveness of the fuzzy enhancement. FAHP is used to produce the fuzzy weights in favour of ranking the candidate networks regarding the multi criteria concept. The fuzzy improvement enables to raise the QoS in all types of traﬃc, comparing with the use of classical AHP weights. It is due to the fact that the choice of the selected network is not distorted by the human intervention.

4.1 Introduction
In this chapter, we focus on the real time selection of the always best connected network in heterogeneous environment using utility function, while maintaining QoS for multimedia services (Conversational, Streaming, Interactive and Background). We adopt, thereby, a utility-function based approach to enhance vertical handover decision; it enables a seamless real-time handover decision according to the network parameters and user’s preferences. We give a detailed description of the utility-function based algorithm proposed in two versions. The ﬁrst approach is concerned with the heterogeneous networks of diﬀerent generations and the second one is particular developed for LTE Cells.

CHAPTER 4. LOAD BALANCED NETWORK SELECTION ALGORITHM IN HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS USING MATCHING GAME

Through this chapter, we propose a solution that provides a context-aware Access Point (AP) selection and association of UEs, which considers the type of application used, to available networks in heterogeneous environment. This scheme focuses on enabling simultaneous invocation of applications with diﬀerent traﬃc and QoS characteristics by the UEs. This solution considers also various link parameters that provide the best solution in terms of QoS which makes it a QoS-aware solution as well. The real time context-aware and QoS-aware access point selection method is based on matching theory. We formulate, thereby, our problem as a matching game, aiming to meet the required QoS of cellular users, randomly distributed heterogeneous networks, then we propose an algorithm that computes the optimal stable matching entailing the assignment of all users to the most suitable network regarding the type of the service each user need. To our best knowledge, a few numbers of works have been published to address user network selection based on QoS-Aware and Context-Aware as well, by putting to use multi Multiple Criteria Decision Making, Fuzzy Logic, Utility Function and Matching Game. The diﬀerence between our proposed scheme and the existing schemes mentioned above lies in the followings: (1). We propose a novel access point selection approach for maximizing performance QoS metrics and minimizing cost QoS metrics regarding the type of traﬃc asked by users. (2). We formulate the problem as a many-to-one matching game in which each user is assigned to one network. (3). We propose a new version of DA which corresponds to our UEs -APs matching goals, in which UEs and APs make their decisions based on their individual preferences (e.g., Type of traﬃc and QoS metrics).

4.2 Matching Game Theory-based Schemes
4.2.1 Utility Function Formulation
The VHD is a measure of the performance of a particular network. It is evaluated for each network that covers a user’s service area. It is a sum of weighted functions of speciﬁc parameters. The utility function is used, in network selection, to evaluate the reachable wireless networks discovered (bandwidth and movement speed as factors) and to quantify the QoS provided by the wireless network.
4.2.1.1 Estimating Network Conditions
To capture the satisfaction level of mobile user when served by some network, utility function is used to measure the normalized satisfaction of mobile user by taking into account diﬀerent criterion. The utility function represents how mobile user satisfaction is varying from low to high values with respect to user’s needs in certain situation. The situation can be a type of application used by the user, the network link state, user’s preferences or a predeﬁned QoS level as in Trestian et al. (2012a).

4.2. MATCHING GAME THEORY-BASED SCHEMES

47

4.2.1.2 Mathematical Model

The utility function is a mathematical model that describes the level of satisfaction of a decision maker or a speciﬁc objective in terms of several variables. This function is often used in the ﬁelds of economics and ﬁnance. It allows to measure in a subjective way the degree of satisfaction of the customer. For the network selection process, the utility function represents the degree of satisfaction of the mobile terminal with respect to a set of services oﬀered by the target network. This function is deﬁned as follows:

M
Ui = wj · fj (nij )
j=1

(4.1)

wj is the weight vector. nij is the value of normalized metric j of network i. M is the number of criterion of each alternative. f () represents the normalization function.

4.2.2 Game Theory
The imbalance between the growing demands of users and limited radio resources poses an imminent challenge in the eﬀective selection of the network. In this context, an eﬃcient dynamic network selection faces several challenges: a) user mobility and network topology is dynamic, b) diﬀerent network infrastructures are likely to interact in the future ; C) users can have diﬀerent behaviors when accessing the available networks (according to their needs); and d) the optimization of network sharing in a centralized approach is generally a problem of multi-objective optimization, very Diﬃcult to analyze and solve. Therefore, Game Theory (GT) Fudenberg and Tirole (1991) is seen as a natural paradigm for studying a network where terminals compete with each other for a common goal of access to the best network. Game theory is a mathematical tool that analyses strategic interactions between rational decision-makers. The simplest representation of a game is the normal form deﬁned as follows:
Deﬁnition 1. Normal Form Game Fudenberg and Tirole (1991)
A game in normal form is denoted by {K, S, uk∀k ∈ K} and is composed of three elements:
 a set of players: K = {1, 2, . . . , K}  a set of strategy proﬁles:S = S1 × . . . × SK where Sk is the strategy set of the kth player  a set of utility functions: The kth player’s utility function is uk : S −→ R+ and is denoted by
uk(sk, s−k) where sk ∈ SK and s−k = (s1, . . . , sk−1, sk+1, . . . , sK ) ∈ S1×. . .×Sk−1×Sk+1×. . .×SK .
The set of players is a ﬁnite set K ⊂ N of which each element represents a player. The strategy set Sk contains the set of actions player k might take in the game. The utility function uk(sk, s−k) allows a player to evaluate the convenience of its strategy sk with respect to the other players’ strategies s−k

4.2.3 Matching Theory

Wireless networks can be described as a diverse interacting selﬁsh and rational agents with a natural propensity to solicit their maximum beneﬁt from the network without caring about other agents, Game theory which has been widely used in open literature to facilitate autonomous network management and dynamic resource allocation cannot deal with complex networks, in which, diﬀerent types of agents with various characteristics and requirements want to interact with each other, and conventional game theoretical models can hardly be utilized Bayat et al. (2016).

Figure 4.1: The general conﬁguration of the matching structure Bayat et al. (2016).
Recently, matching theory has emerged as a promising technique for wireless resource allocation which can overcome some limitations of game theory and optimization. Matching theory is a Nobelprize winning framework that provides mathematically tractable solutions for the combinatorial problem of matching players in two distinct sets , depending on the individual information and preference of each player. The advantages of matching theory for wireless resource management include: 1) suitable models for characterizing interactions between heterogeneous nodes, each of which has its own type, objective, and information, 2) ability to deﬁne general “preferences” that can handle heterogeneous and complex considerations related to wireless QoS, 3) suitable solutions, in terms of stability and optimality, that accurately reﬂect diﬀerent system objectives, and 4) eﬃcient algorithmic implementations that are inherently self-organizing and amenable to fast implementation Irving et al. (1987), Roth and Sotomayor (1992), Naparstek et al. (2014).
In game theory, utility is a measure of motivation of a player over a set of actions and evaluate the overall satisfaction of a player in matching games. It combines all the multiple related parameters to a single number to represent the net losses and gainsHossain et al. (2009). These parameters can be

4.2. MATCHING GAME THEORY-BASED SCHEMES

of diﬀerent types. Utility functions have been widely used in wireless literature to model various radio resource management problems Liu et al. (2006),Jiang et al. (2005).

4.2.3.1 Preference list
The main goal of matching is to optimally match two sets of agents together, given their individual utilities. [Although the main matching models in the literature are between the two sets of agents, it should be noted that there are matching models that are among the agents in one set only (that are basic cooperative game models), and matching models among three sets of agents Eriksson et al. (2006). known as three-dimensional matching. It is notable that three-dimensional matchings are still under study and are beyond the scope of this tutorial.]

4.2.3.2 Basic Matching Deﬁnitions
The basic wireless resource management problem can be posed as a matching problem between resources and users. Depending on the scenario, the resources can be of diﬀerent abstraction levels, representing base stations, time-frequency chunks, power, or others. Users can be devices, stations, or smartphone applications. Each user and resource has a quota that deﬁnes the maximum number of players with which it can be matched. The main goal of matching is to optimally match resources and users, given their individual, often diﬀerent objectives and learned information. Each user (resource) builds a ranking of the resources (users) using a preference relation. The concept of a preference represents the individual view that each resource or user has on the other set, based on local information. In its basic form, a preference can simply be deﬁned in terms of an objective utility function that quantiﬁes the QoS achieved by a certain resource-user matching. However, a preference is more generic than a utility function in that it can incorporate additional qualitative measures extracted from the information available to users and resources Gu et al. (2015). A matching is essentially an allocation between resources and users. The basic solution concept for a matching problem is the so-called two-sided stable matching. A matching is said to be two-sided stable, if and only if there is no blocking pair (BP). A BP for a stable marriage case is deﬁned as a pair of user and resource (u, r), where u prefers r to its currently matched user j, and r prefers u to its currently matched resource k. Thus, u will leave i to be matched to r and r would prefer being matched to user u than user k.

4.2.3.3 Conventional Classiﬁcation The classical classiﬁcation of matching problems is based on the values of the player quotas as follows :
 One-to-one matching: Each player can be matched to at most one member of the opposite set. The most prominent example is the stable marriage problem in which men and women need to be

50

CHAPTER 4. LOAD BALANCED NETWORK SELECTION ALGORITHM IN HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS USING MATCHING GAME

matched for marriage.
 Many-to-one matching: Here, in one of the sets, at least one player can be matched to multiple players of the opposing set, while in the other set, every player has exactly one match. One example is the college admissions problem in which one student can be matched to one university while a university can recruit multiple students.
 Many-to-many matching: At least one player within each of the two sets could be matched to more than one member in the other set. Many-to-many matching is the most general type of problems and it admits many examples such as creating partnerships in peer-to-peer networks.

There exists other classiﬁcations for matching problems, such as based on the partitioning of players, and the preference requirement for players. However, such classes can be often derived as special cases of the above matching problems.

4.2.3.4 Basic Algorithmic Solution: Deferred Acceptance
The seminal result in matching theory shows that at least one stable matching exists for general preferences in conventional one-to-one and one-to-many gamesGale and Shapley (1962). This work also introduced an eﬃcient algorithm, known as the Deferred Algorithm (DA) algorithm (polynomial time for one-to-one and empirically very fast for one-to-many) which can ﬁnd such a matching. DA is an iterative procedure, shown in ﬁgure 4.2, in which players in one set make proposals to the other set, whose players, in turn, decide to accept or reject these proposals, respecting their quota. Users and resources make their decisions based on their individual preferences (e.g., available information or QoS metric). This process admits many distributed implementations which do not require the players to know each other’s preferences Gale and Shapley (1962)

4.3 Proposed Utility-based Multi-Criteria Selection for Heterogeneous Networks

4.3.1 System Model
For network selection decision, utility function assigned to the satisfaction that a network provides to mobile users. Diﬀerent available networks with diﬀerent user preferences will have diﬀerent utility values. Thus, in this chapter, we propose a context-aware scheme of network selection based on utility function and considers both mobile user’s awareness and provider’s constraints. The selection decision function is deﬁned as a utility function consisting of four parameters Bandwidth, Delay, Jitter and Bit Error Rate. During the network selection procedure, we consider multiple attributes together, so the utilities of multiple attributes are combined as a total utility. We consider four real time applications.

Figure 4.3: Utility-based Algorithm Block.
As reported in the algorithm block in ﬁgure 4.3, simulation provides the system with the metrics in real time and a the utility function is applied according to each QoS application: Conversational, Streaming, Interactive and Background involving by that the context awareness of the users.
4.3.2 Utility Computation for Heterogeneous Access Points (Drissi et al., 2017a)
To capture the satisfaction level of mobile user when served by some network, we use utility function, which measures the normalized satisfaction of mobile user by taking into account Bandwidth, Delay, Jitter and Bit Error Rate of each available network. Hence, the utility should be high and the decision is made accordingly. The utility function represents how mobile user satisfaction is varying from low to high values with respect to user’s needs in terms of application. The applications that we study in this paper are Conversational, Streaming, Interactive and Background.
Network Selection Decision Network selection QoS metrics can be divided into two categories: Cost metrics and metric of performance. For metric of performance, the best utility value is the largest, like bandwidth, RSS, throughput, reliability degree, etc. Conversely, for a cost metric, the best utility value is the lowest, like delay, jitter, bit error rate, etc. However, in order to deﬁne a utility function that considers mobile user’s needs, the network metrics are not enough. Thus, another important factor that

52

CHAPTER 4. LOAD BALANCED NETWORK SELECTION ALGORITHM IN HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS USING MATCHING GAME

has been considered is the type of applications in terms of QoS requirements. Indeed, applications are classiﬁed as inelastic, partially elastic and perfectly elastic based on their sensitivity to QoS parameters. For example, real-time voice (Conversational) and video applications (Streaming) are inelastic in their demand for bandwidth and their delay requirements, whereas data transfer, e-mail or web browsing (Interactive and Background) applications are considered perfectly elastic, i.e. tolerant to variations in bandwidth and delay Shenker (1995). The equations below deﬁne the mathematical models of utilityfunction for both performance and cost metrics.

For a metric of performance, the utility is calculated as follow:

fP erf ormance(x)

=

min(x, xmax) − xmin xmax − xmin

(4.2)

For a cost metric, the utility is:

fCost(x)

=

xmax − max(x, xmin) xmax − xmin

(4.3)

xmax et xmin are the minimum and the maximum requirements of a metric in a speciﬁc type of application, the values of are provided in table 4.1.

Table 4.1: Application QoS requirements and utility function parameters.

Bit Error Rate (%)

Finally, in order to determine the relevance Rij of network i for an application j (Eq. (4.10)), we combine the utility values of all metrics using three calibration coeﬃcients as following:

Rij = α · fBandwidth + β · fDelay + γ · fJitter + δ · fBitErrorRate

(4.4)

Where α + β + γ + δ = 1. Eq. (4.4) 0 ≤ Rij ≤ 1 the closer Rij is to 1, the more relevant network i is to application j.
In a scenario where bandwidth, delay, jitter and bit error rate are evenly set up, we take α = β = γ = δ = 1/4. However, many conceivable scenarios can be patterned by conveniently assessing α, β, γ and δ.

4.3.3 Customized Utility Computation for LTE Heterogeneous cells (Drissi et al., 2016c)

LTE networks consist of deploying heterogeneous cells with diﬀerent access in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as: Bandwidth, latency, coverage range... etc. One of the critical issues that aﬀect the QoS of connection is the choice of next handed network during the Handover. Handover is a system by which mobile node keeps its connection active even when it wanders from the coverage area of one cell to another’s. In LTE the X2-Handover procedure is used for the inter-eNB handover which is the subject of our paper. It is crucial because the participating cells are heterogeneous and have diﬀerent characteristics. In this case the signal strength sometimes is not suﬃcient to handle the handover and therefore dynamic parameters like velocity and delay should be considered.
LTE macrocells support multimedia services over a wide range of coverage whereas femtocells cover a limited area both with high bandwidth, they are complementary to each other in terms of coverage, thus the integration of such small cells overcome limitations of coverage and the user can move easily. In such overlapped coverage, appropriate handover decision reduces the number of unnecessary handover. In 3GPP LTE, handover depends on properties such as UE-assisted, where the UE provides measurement report to the network. And Network-controlled property where the network (i.e. source and target eNBs communicate) makes a decision when to trigger the handover and launch its execution. Such scheme decreases the QoS of application. It need an enhancement in terms of number of handovers, satisfaction of QoS required by users and execution of a seamless switching from one network to another with minimum loss rate. To this end, we propose a simple handover algorithm that confronts these challenges in Macrocell / Femtocell high speed scenario.

4.3.3.1 Background of LTE Handover Procedure
In this section, we present some backgrounds on the classical handover procedure in LTE 3GPP. LTE handover procedure within 3GPP LTE deﬁned in LTE (2009) has three main phases: Handover initiation, handover preparation and handover completion.

Handover Initiation The HO procedure starts with the measurement reporting of a handover event by the UE to the serving eNB. The UE periodically performs downlink radio channel measurements based on the reference symbols (RS); namely, the UE can measure the reference symbols received power (RSRP) and the reference symbols received quality (RSRQ). If certain network conﬁgured conditions are satisﬁed, the UE sends the corresponding measurement report indicating the triggered event. In addition, the measurement report indicates the cell to which the UE has to be handed over, which is called target cell. This process is detailed in section 4.3.3.2

54

CHAPTER 4. LOAD BALANCED NETWORK SELECTION ALGORITHM IN HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS USING MATCHING GAME

Handover Preparation Based on these measurement reports, the serving eNB starts handover preparation. The HO preparation involves exchanging of signalling between serving and target eNB and admission control of the UE in the target cell. The communication interface between the serving and the target eNB is called X2. Upon successful HO preparation, the HO decision is made and consequently the HO Command will be sent to the UE.

The connection between UE and the serving cell will be released. Then, the UE attempts to synchronize and access the target eNB, by using the random access channel (RACH). To speed up the handover procedure, the target cell can allocate a dedicated RACH preamble-included in HO command to the UE. Upon successful synchronization at the target eNB, this last one transmits an uplink scheduling grant to the UE.

Handover Completion The UE responds with a HO Conﬁrm message, which notiﬁes the completion of the HO procedure at the radio access network part. It is noted that the described signalling messages belong to the Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol.

4.3.3.2 Cell Selection Handover Driven by UE
UE Measurements and Decision Basically, source eNB arranges how UEs report their proximities. When the UE sends approximation indication, source eNB conﬁgures the UE with the most recent measurement controls. These measurements include a list of all neighbouring cells which helps the UE in operating a faster and less battery consuming browsing.
If this list is not given, the UE will just detect those cells with a Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) exceeding the UE’s receiver sensitivity. These measurement conﬁgurations also include the assignments by which the UE start taking or not any further measurements. Usually, these measurements can be triggered by an event or periodically triggered.

UE Cell Selection One of the critical issues that aﬀect the QoS of a certain connection is the choice of next handed cell during the handover in LTE networks. The network controlled handover where the network (i.e. source and target eNBs) makes a decision when to trigger the handover or not is not suitable for user’s preferences considerations. Our cell selection scheme can be processed in Two phases:
 Information collection phase by UE.  Cell Selection Decision by UE.

Information Collection Phase As a ﬁrst stage of handover scheme, the information collected by UE will be reported to eNB. It has a decisive impact on the success of the overall handover process.

4.3. PROPOSED UTILITY-BASED MULTI-CRITERIA SELECTION FOR HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS

55

Indeed, the network must be well controlled to handle a seamless handover with no disruption of the current connection. Thus, information collection process is called regarding the application requirements, network conditions and user preference variations.

Network selection QoS metrics can be divided into two categories: Cost metrics and metric of performance. For metric of performance, the best utility value is the largest, like bandwidth, RSS, throughput, reliability degree, etc. Conversely, for a cost metric, the best utility value is the lowest, like delay, jitter, bit error rate, etc. In our approach handover triggering is based on throughput, delay, jitter and bit error rate with the nearest cell. those metrics are repeatedly reported to the network.

Consequently, the next phase is applied.

Cell Selection Decision The main goal of this phase is to determine, among the available LTE cells,

the optimal one for an UE. The selected network must provide the best available QoS and network stability

according to the metrics reported in information collection phase by each user. In eNBs sides, Each cell

is scored according to the metrics, provided in UE reports in the previous phase, by minimizing the cost

metrics and maximizing the performance metrics. The handover decision problem can be formulated as

a vector form, where vector elements correspond to the metrics: Throughput, Delay, Jitter and Bit Error

Rate. As all evaluated metrics are expressed in diﬀerent measurement units, it is necessary to convert

them into normalized values before attributing scores to the cells. For a metric of performance, the score

is calculated as follow:

4
SP erformance = max(nij )
j=1

(4.5)

For a cost metric, the score is :

4
SCost(x) == min(nij )
j=1

(4.6)

Where nij is the value of normalized metric i reported by j UE. Finally, in order to determine the overall score C of a cell we combine the score values of all metrics:

C = α × ST hroughput + β × SDelay + γ × SJitter + δ × SBer

(4.7)

In a scenario where bandwidth, delay, jitter and bit error rate are evenly set up, we take α = β = γ = δ = 1/4. However, many conceivable scenarios can be patterned by conveniently assessing α, β, γ and δ.
At this step, each cell is scored and in UE side, while roaming between cells, the selection can be made by choosing the nearest cell with minimum score.

We consider the transmission in a topology consisting of ν access point cells and χ users. Let ν = 1, 2, ..., N denotes the AP networks set. χ = 1, 2, ..., M denotes the user set located in the available networks coverage. Each user has a set of available APs i.e., the available APs set of user m denoted by Am ⊆ ν. Based on each APs condition of loading and UEs preferences, each user (m) can only access one AP (ap) at same time. Explicitly, on one hand, a user’s association is not only about link’s state, but also about the load on the associated network and resource allocation arrangement used by the network side and on the other hand, the UE has its part of decision since the choice include user’s context. For resource allocation arrangement in network side, we use a QoS awareness policy that express the proportional fairness based on a QoS metrics of the links. With these considerations in mind, we propose, also, that APs Selection decision is based on the UE’s context, more exactly, the context of diﬀerent types of service adopted by the UEs.

4.4. LOAD BALANCED NETWORK SELECTION ALGORITHM IN HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS USING MATCHING GAME

57

4.4.1.2 QoS Awareness: Utility Function

To seizure the contentment extent, of an UE when served by an AP, varying from low to high values regarding the QoS requirements, we abstracted the idea of system model 4.3.1, where a scheme of network selection that considers QoS awareness based on utility function consisting of four parameters Bandwidth, Delay, Jitter and Bit Error Rate. According to authors, QoS metrics can be segregated into two groups: Cost metrics and metric of performance. For metric of performance, the best utility value is the largest, such as bandwidth, RSS, throughput, reliability degree, etc. Conversely, for a cost metric, the best utility value is the lowest, as delay, jitter, bit error rate, etc. The equations (Eq. (4.8)) and (Eq. (4.9)) deﬁne the utility functions for both performance and cost metrics:

uP erf ormance(x)

=

min(x, xmax) − xmin xmax − xmin

For a cost metric, the utility is :

(4.8)

uCost(x)

=

xmax − max(x, xmin) xmax − xmin

xmax et xmin are the minimum and the maximum requirements of a QoS metric.

(4.9)

Finally, the utility Uap∈ν(m) of an AP is deﬁned (Eq. (4.10)), as a combination of the utility values of all metrics using calibration coeﬃcients of a value of wq = 1/4 as following:

Um∈χ(ap ∈ Am) = wq · uq
q⊂Q

(4.10)

Where Q is a set of QoS metrics, namely: Throughput, Delay, Jitter and Bit Error Rate, and 0 ≤ U ≤ 1 in which the closer Um∈χ(ap ∈ Am) is to 1, the more relevant the access point ap is to the user m.

In a scenario where throughput, delay, jitter and bit error rate are equally arranged, a calibration of 1/4 is used. Nonetheless, a countless possible sketches can be designed by eﬃciently gauging the calibration. The most convenient scenario is to express the type of application asked by the UE.

4.4.1.3 Context Awareness: Weight Distribution Algorithm
The concept of context awareness has been widely studied in pervasive computer science, and it is relatively novel in wireless networks. In this section, we used the context awareness as complementary to QoS awareness, deﬁned by the user’s context that designates the type of application, i.e, Conversational, Streaming, Interactive and Background. For this purpose, we calibrate the weights wq in equation (Eq. (4.10)) instead of 1/4 to reveal the importance of a QoS metric in a certain type of application. In furtherance of apprehending such context awareness, we used FAHP proposed in section 3 to calculate the weights wq of the QoS metric used in the previous section, i.e., Throughput, Delay, Jitter and Bit

58

CHAPTER 4. LOAD BALANCED NETWORK SELECTION ALGORITHM IN HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS USING MATCHING GAME

Error Rate, for each application used by UE. Pursuant to the authors, FAHP calculates the weight vector wq which represents the importance of each QoS metric in a certain application. It provides as results wqm > 0 the weight of the qth metric by UE m. Given that q⊂Q wqm = 1. The major step of FAHP is to generate the relative fuzzy importance ratio of each pair of QoS metrics as a fuzzy evaluation matrix. Using Triangular Fuzzy Numbers (TFNs) and via pairwise comparison, the fuzzy evaluation matrix R = (ri,j)q∗q; q ⊂ Q is modelled for each type of application as : ri,j = (xi,j, yi,j, zi,j) and ri−,j1 = (1/zi,j, 1/yi,j, 1/xi,j) such as x ≤ y ≤ z. Accordingly, the fuzzy weighted importance for all types of applications are calculated using the Extent Analysis Method Chang (1996). The weight vectors are correspondingly generated for each type of application. Upon that, the context awareness is highlighted and the AP selection considers the type of application used by the UE.

4.4.2 Proposed Solution (Drissi et al., 2017c)

4.4.2.1 Problem Formulation

Through the modelling in section 4.4, we are adept to establish the QoS-Aware and Context-Aware AP selection by associating a set of UEs to most suitable AP, for which it can meet the respective QoS requirements. In order to formalize the UE-AP matching problem, we deﬁne a suitable QoS-Aware and Context-aware utility function for a UE as follows:

Um∈χ(ap ∈ Am) =

wqm · um q

q⊂Q

(4.11)

Where q⊂Q wq(m) = 1 for each user m. Note that this utility captures QoS awareness that an AP can convey by taking into consideration a set Q of QoS metrics, i.e., Throughput, delay, jitter and bit error rate. Furthermore, the utility in equation (Eq. (4.11)) accordingly reckons for the UE’s predilection and context awareness in terms of applications through wqm.

Having prescribed such utility in equation (Eq. (4.11)), we plan to solve the problem of matching each UE (m ∈ χ) in the topology to the most suitable AP (ap ∈ Am) among available APs set Am ⊆ ν through a matching ρ : χ −→ ν. Basically, this leads us to the following maximization problem:

Subject to:

max
ρ:(m,ap)∈ρ

Uap∈ν (m) = max
ρ:(m,ap)∈ρ

wqm · um q

m∈χ

m∈χ q⊂Q

(5.5)

ρ(ap, m) ∈ {0, 1}, ap ∈ Am, m ∈ χ.

(5.5.a)

Constraint 5.5.a ensures that an available AP ap in our system can be: relevant or irrelevant if accessed

4.4. LOAD BALANCED NETWORK SELECTION ALGORITHM IN HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS USING MATCHING GAME

59

by an UE m. ρ(ap, m) stands for the matching index (such as: ρ(x) = y ⇔ ρ(x, y) = 1). It guarantees, also, that user can only access to one AP. We note that the UE-AP association (ap, m) in equation (Eq. (4.11)) is a integer programming problem, which is NP hard program. The complexity will depends on the number of APs and users in the network and signiﬁcantly increase with the network size Shao et al. (2016).

One advisable strategy for evolving such a self-organizing UE-AP association approach which can solve equation (Eq. (5.5)) is disposed by the framework of matching games detailed in section below.

4.4.2.2 Matching Game Formulation
To determine the best AP for a certain UE regarding the network link state and the UE preferences, we formulate the problem as association scheme that can be solved by the theory of many-to-one matching game where each player can be adapted to several players of the other set. A well-known cases of this problem have been mentioned in Bodine-Baron et al. (2011) such as: matching medical interns to hospitals for residencies, students college admissions, the workers market and classic ﬁrms.
In view of this, one UE is matched to only one AP, while one AP can match to many UEs, but has a maximum allowance limit (quota) λmax to not exceed (an AP can service only a maximum number of UEs). The deﬁnition is given below. For better perception of the matching game, we assume that Am = ν which means that the UEs roam in the coverage of all the APs in the system. Hence, as we deﬁned in section 4.4.1.1, ν = {ap1, ap2, ..., apN } and χ = {m1, m2, ..., mM } two separate and ﬁnite sets, denoting AP networks set and UEs set located in the available networks coverage, respectively. For each AP, there exists a positive integer λmax which indicates the maximum allowance number of positions an AP can aﬀord. The solution of this game is a matching between APs and UE satisfying their predilections and prerequisites is given by the theory of matching games Roth and Sotomayor (1992).
Deﬁnition 2. Concept of Matching
A matching is a subset ρ ∈ ⊆ χ ⊗ ν such that:

Where:

  |ρ(m)| = 1  |ρ(ap)| = λmax
ρ(m) = {ap ∈ ν : (m, ap) ∈ }.

(4.13) (5.6.a)

60

CHAPTER 4. LOAD BALANCED NETWORK SELECTION ALGORITHM IN HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS USING MATCHING GAME

And:

ρ(ap) = {m ∈ χ : (m, ap) ∈ }.

(5.6.b)

Deﬁnition 3. Concept of Matching Stability A matching ρ is said to be two-sided stable if and only if there is no blocking pair.
Deﬁnition 4. Concept of Matching Blocking The matching ρ(m, ap) is blocked by a player if this latter choose to be unmatched instead of being
matched at ρ(m, ap).

According to Hamidouche et al. (2016) stability refers to the state in which a player would not have the incentive to leave its group of players given that the other players have selected their partners or group mates. Thus, the stability is the goal of the matching game.
At this point, each UE can deﬁne its preferences over available APs implicitly by the weights in the utility function in equation (Eq. (5.5)) considering that an AP is either relevant or irrelevant to the UE according to the constraint 5.5.a. Whereas an AP must respect a quota while deﬁning its preferences over UEs. Here, we deﬁne an Ap preference relation over UEs.
Deﬁnition 5. Preference Relation
Preference relation is deﬁned as a complete, reﬂexive, and transitive binary relation over a list of APs, allowing each player UE U m ∈ χ to build a list of preferences over APs, i.e., to rank, the players in ν.

Correspondingly, for any UE m a preference relation over the set of APs ν is labelled as follow: For any two APs ap, ap∗ ∈ ν, ap = ap∗, and two matching ρ, ρ∗ ∈ ⊆ χ ⊗ ν. Where ap = ρ(m), ap∗ = ρ∗(m):

ρ(m, ap) ρ∗(m, ap∗) ⇔ Uap∈ν (m) Uap∗∈ν (m)

(5.7)

Accordingly, By observing the preference relation in equation (Eq. (5.7)), we can aﬃrm that the choice of an Access Point do depend on the other decisions made by the UEs in the network. Thus, the preferences of UEs and APs consider the existing matching in the topology.

4.4.3 Proposed Algorithm
Heretofore, we have modelled the problem stated in (Eq. (5.5)) as a many-to-one matching game where the players are the access points APs and users UEs. Each user is able to choose and apply to the most suitable APs regarding the type of traﬃc used. Conversely, the AP can enlist one or more users respecting

4.4. LOAD BALANCED NETWORK SELECTION ALGORITHM IN HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS USING MATCHING GAME

61

the maximum number of allowance λmax. As a distributed algorithm, we propose that the APs and UEs deﬁne individual preferences over one another, based on weights computation in equation (Eq. (4.11)) for the UEs and the preference relations in equation (Eq. (5.7)) for the APs.

To identify a stable matching for UE-AP association, we propose Algorithm 4.2, composed of two main fragments: Context-Awareness and QoS-Awareness utility formulation and Matching Assessment. At the ﬁrst beginning, the UEs are formerly assigned to a certain AP. The ﬁrst fragment consists of exchanging context data and network performance metrics between UEs and APs. Every UE m ∈ χ pinpoints the set of APs ν in its neighbourhood and the utilities are accordingly calculated. The second fragment covers the matching evaluation. Using the preference relations (Eq. (5.7)), each AP creates and ranks a waiting lists and rejects the rest users. The UEs enrolled to a certain AP cancel the proposals to the other APs and the rejected ones reapply to other APs. This process is repeated until convergence to stability of matching.

4.4.3.1 Numerical Example

Let us discern algorithm 4.2 in a small size example. Figure 4.4 presents An example of the problem of matching solved in this chapter, in a topology consisting of three UEs trying to select the best AP among two APs. χ = {ue1, ue2, ue3} and ν = {ap1, ap2}. Let’s suppose that each AP admits two UE, λmax = 2. UEs supply the computed weights to the APs. Each AP calculates and ranks the utilities according to the user’s needs and considering q ⊂ Q QoS metrics and choose λmax = 2 UEs.

Figure 4.4: A matching example of three UEs and two APs.

Tables 4.2 and 4.3 depicts, respectively, the UEs weights supplied to the APs and the real time link measurements of the available APs. According to equation (Eq. (4.11)), the ﬁrst fragment of algorithm 4.2 is executed and the calculated utilities are presented in table 4.4. By running the second fragment of the algorithm, the utilities are acknowledged to the UEs and the ranking lists are generated. The UEs select the most matched AP, hence, ue2 chooses to connect to ap2. In the second iteration, ue3 has to make a decision between ap1 and ap2, it selects ap2 in consideration of the maximal utility and since λmax = 2, ue1 is rejected from the ap2 list. ue2 and ue3 cancel requests to ap2. Finally, ue1 is admitted to ap2 as the list is empty and still can aﬀord users. Thereby, a stable matching is reached shown in table 4.5.

4.5 Conclusion
In heterogeneous networks, the required QoS can be achieved through an eﬃcient VHD that combines the requirements of mobile users and networks. In this chapter, we proposed a context-aware scheme of network selection based on utility function and considers both mobile user’s needs and provider’s constraints. On one hand, The selection decision function is deﬁned as a utility function consisting of four parameters bandwidth, delay, jitter and bit error rate. We have considered four distinct real time applications in the process of selection. On the other hand we implemented two versions of the scheme. The ﬁrst one is applicable to heterogeneous of diﬀerent types and the second one is dedicated to LTE cells.
In wireless heterogeneous networks, the compulsory QoS perceived by users and aﬀordable from operators can be attained through an ubiquitous vertical handover that fuses the mobile users prerequisite and networks capacities. In this chapter, we proposed a QoS -aware and context-aware scheme of network selection based on matching theory which considers both mobile user’s needs and provider’s hindrances. The decision operation inﬂicts the agreement of both sides. Indeed, the matching of UEs to APs considers preferences lists based on utility function on the network side, consisting of four QoS metrics, i.e.,

throughput, delay, jitter and bit error rate. Whilst, on the user side, a set of weights are generated to express the context awareness of the type of application used by each user.

5.1 Introduction
Performance assessment is one of the most challenging challenges often faced by proposed solutions in the context of network selection. Indeed, to judge that such a solution of the handover is better compared to another, it is essential to compare the performances of these solutions. To make this comparison, two points must be taken into account, the ﬁrst being the choice of the platform, the evaluation model and the identiﬁcation of the evaluation parameters. Given the usefulness of the evaluation as a very important step in the design phase and the development of a handover algorithm, several evaluation models are proposed in the literature. However, not all of these models take into account the degree of importance of each evaluation parameter. For this reason, we have developed a scalable evaluation model for algorithms for network selection. In simulation section, we aim to analyse and evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. We ran a set of NS3 simulations experiments operating the proposed algorithms for the two main contributions, the obtained results are compared.

5.2 Proposed Algorithms Simulation Campaigns

5.2.1 Network Conﬁguration et Simulation Parameters
5.2.1.1 Network Topology
To assess the presented schemes, on the network side, we consider two available networks (Wi-Fi and LTE). Both are ideal partners for operators to deliver convenient and aﬀordable services, they are wireless standards built from scratch for IP-based applications. We used the same scenario for all the proposed network selection schemes. The entire simulated area is covered under one LTE cell of radius 500 m with its eNB located at the center of the region and one Wi-Fi access point range of 100 m overlapped with LTE cell in 500 − By − 500 area, where 10 mobile nodes randomly distributed are deployed. The behaviours of QoS metrics considered by the schemes are calculated, in this paper, using the built-in FlowMonitor NS-3 tool that tracks per-ﬂow statistics at the IP layer including throughput and latency and reliability.
As for the mobility model, all the nodes are mobile and follow the built-in Constant Velocity Mobility Model of NS3 while meandering betwixt WiFi and LTE in simulated area.

5.2.1.2 Application Scenarios
On the user side, we consider four scenarios with diﬀerent types of application were generated in Network Simulator NS3, namely Conversational, Streaming, Interactive and Background traﬃcs. Those services are a Client-Server based applications with diﬀerent requirements implemented on top of IP and using either UDP or TCP. The applications are designed as:
 Conversational: A CBR voice traﬃc is designed to perform the conversational class traﬃc. The client mobile terminal engender traﬃc in 84 Kbits/sec. The voice call duration is equal to the duration of the simulation.
 Streaming: A CBR traﬃc designed as a video streaming between the client mobile terminal to server. The data rate simulated is steadily 1 Mbits/sec. The duration of a CBR video streaming is equal to the duration of the simulation as well.
 Interactive: The web browsing traﬃc is designed for the interactive application. The retrieved web page sizes randomly vary between 100 − 500 Kilobytes. The duration of the web browsing application is also equal to the duration of the simulation.
 Background: E-mailing traﬃc is designed for the background traﬃc, in-which each mail size randomly vary between 25 − 100 Kilobytes. E-mailing traﬃc’ duration is equal to the duration of the

simulation.

Each traﬃc class is combined with four diﬀerent QoS parameters or attributes: Throughput, Delay, Jitter, and BER. The four traﬃc classes have diﬀerent QoS requirements presented in table 5.1.

Many handover triggers can be adopted. However, the handover process is launched in real time regularly every 5 seconds in order to get the potential out of the schemes. All the simulations last 600 seconds. Simulations details and results are presented below.

5.2.2 Evaluation Criteria
The objective of the experiments is to analyse and compare the eﬀectiveness of proposed selection. To this end, we analyse the QoS metrics, delay and packet loss, inasmuch as those QoS metrics translate the satisfaction of greedy mobile users. In addition, delay and packet loss change constantly over the simulation each time the selection process is called. On one hand, delay is concerned by the time taken by the algorithm to converge which involves the time from the sending and receiving a packet by the source to the destination. On the other hand, a certain number of packets are lost during the vertical handover execution which has an inﬂuence on the Packet Loss Rate. All results are obtained by averaging over a

68

CHAPTER 5. APPLICATION FOR HETEROGENEOUS NETWORK IN MOBILE SCENARIOS

large number of independent simulation runs.

 Delay: is the time elapsing from the sending of a packet by the source until it is received by the destination.
 Packet Loss Rate: is ratio of the number of non delivered packet by transmitted ones.  Throughput: is the number of messages successfully delivered per unit time.  Number of Handovers: is the average number of handovers per second.

The following section details the development of the network throughout the simulation.

5.3 Evaluation Results
5.3.1 MADM Scheme Performance Evaluation
With the constraints applied in our simulations, the high speed and the regular handover triggering, it is hard to achieve, every-time, seamless handover and preserve a stable connectivity. The QoS parameters of the available networks vary dynamically over time in terms of reliability and availability (i.e. throughput, delay, jitter and bit error rate), which are the parameters considered in all the decision schemes. In addition, user mobility results in a continuous change in environmental conditions, including the network operator and the service provider, as well as access network technology. In particular, the transfer is a main source of network variations in terms of packet delay and packet loss. Therefore, the handover delay and the packet loss rate are measured to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework.
5.3.1.1 Delay Measurements
Figures 6.5a, 6.5b, 5.3 and 5.4, exhibit, over time, the development of delay in the four scenarios. The contrast of the performances using FAHP against AHP weights, coupled with the ranking methods TOPSIS, VIKOR, MEW and SAW, is noticeable. A common observation is that the schemes that use fuzzy weights provide the lowest end-to-end delay in all types of traﬃc except for the SAW scheme, where, at a certain time, the AHP-SAW outperforms the fuzzy version FAHP-SAW. This shift is due to a shift of the type of technology used. This shoddy network choice of FAHP-SAW - based on the addition of the product of the fuzzy weight and real time link state of diﬀerent QoS metrics - inﬂuences the system delay in a bad way. In long terms, the scheme’ performances start to drop and elects the network with the best throughput and bit error rate, but ignored the latency (delay and jitter) of the network.
In conversational traﬃc shown in ﬁgure 6.5a, the delay produced by all methods tends to be constant during the simulation, however, it can be seen that the diﬀerence between AHP schemes and FAHP ones

5.3. EVALUATION RESULTS

69

diﬀers. For example, MEW introduces relatively higher delay for conversational calls when using AHP weights and improved with the fuzzy achievement. Also, an increasing of gap between AHP and FAHP is noticed in VIKOR scheme; this latter is due to the drop of the performance of the AHP-VIKOR. Yet, VIKOR provides better delays in AHP and FAHP schemes comparing with the other methods.

Figure 5.2: AHP and FAHP Performances of Delay over Time in Streamig Traﬃc.

CHAPTER 5. APPLICATION FOR HETEROGENEOUS NETWORK IN MOBILE SCENARIOS

The delay in Streaming traﬃc is shown in ﬁgure 6.5b. The worst delay performance is produced, almost evenly, by MEW and TOPSIS. Whereas VIKOR scheme provide the best delay when combined with AHP weights and even better delay with the fuzzy improvement.

In Interactive traﬃc presented in ﬁgure 5.3, the lowest delays is noticed in VIKOR scheme as well, even-though the fuzzy weights provided by FAHP did not improve greatly the delay, the average delays all along the simulation in FAHP-VIKOR is not much higher than AHP-VIKOR. However, FAHP surprisingly improved MEW performance with the lowest delay.

Figure 5.3: AHP and FAHP Performances of Delay over Time in Interactive Traﬃc.
The delay in background traﬃc is displayed in ﬁgure 5.4. Clearly, VIKOR introduces the least delays in both AHP and FAHP versions. MEW and TOPSIS Schemes induce relatively the same delays with a narrow improvement when using FAHP, while the delay in SAW algorithm declines considerably and provides the highest delay.

5.3. EVALUATION RESULTS

71

Figure 5.4: AHP and FAHP Performances of Delay over Time in Background Traﬃc.
5.3.1.2 Packet Loss Rate Measurements
Concerning Packet Loss Rate, it is deﬁned as the total number of lost data packets divided by the total number of transmitted data packets. The packet loss rate of the four types of traﬃc is computed. Figures 5.5, 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8 evince, over time, the development of packet loss rate in the four scenarios. With time, the packet loss rate in AHP and FAHP schemes increase in all types of traﬃc, however, the distinction of the performances of AHP and FAHP when coupled with the ranking methods cited above is put in evidence. The rapidity of the decisions made using fuzzy enhancement impacts also on the number of packets discarded throughout the simulation.
From ﬁgure 5.5, which represents the Conversational traﬃc, it can be seen that the packet loss rate in MEW and TOPSIS is more than the one in SAW, whereas VIKOR provide the best packet loss rates in both AHP and FAHP in voice call application.

Figure 5.6: AHP and FAHP Performances of Packet Loss Rate over Time in Streaming Traﬃc.
In Streaming traﬃc presented in ﬁgure 5.6, MEW and TOPSIS achieve relatively higher packet loss rates than SAW and VIKOR. Moreover, the gaps between AHP and FAHP in MEW and TOPSIS are not quite high, which means the fuzzy weights have not a strong impact on the decision made by either MEW or TOPSIS in video streaming application. Nonetheless, VIKOR scheme provides the best performance

5.3. EVALUATION RESULTS

73

in terms of packet loss as well.

Figure 5.7 displays the development of the packet loss rate, in the Interactive traﬃc, for all the schemes. Similarly to the Streaming traﬃc, the fuzzy weights did not impact notably the packet loss rate in MEW scheme; nevertheless, the improvement is obvious for TOPSIS scheme. In VIKOR scheme, a slight enhancement was produced. Nonetheless, the gap between AHP-SAW and FAHP-SAW schemes is the largest. FAHP-SAW provided thereby the largest packet loss rate improvement in web browsing traﬃc.

Figure 5.7: AHP and FAHP Performances of Packet Loss over Time in Interactive Traﬃc.
In background traﬃc depicted in ﬁgure 5.8, the packet loss rate improvement made by FAHP is irrefutable in MEW, SAW and TOPSIS schemes. However, in VIKOR scheme, the fuzzy weights had not impact on the packet loss rate, yet, FAHP-VIKOR provided the least packet loss rate in emailing application.

5.3.1.3 Applications Assessment

Table 5.3 below presents the delay improvement of the schemes when coupled with FAHP under the four types of traﬃc. The FAHP weights improved, for certain, the delay for all schemes as it minimizes the delay up to 10%.

In table 5.4 below the packet loss rate improvement of the schemes when combined with FAHP under the four types of traﬃc is disclosed. The FAHP weights decreased the packet loss rate for all schemes comparing with the use of AHP weights, since it drops up to 32%.

However, even if the delay improvement, in the conversational traﬃc, is more signiﬁcant for FAHPMEW scheme (see table 5.3), the best delay was actually provided by FAHP-VIKOR (see ﬁgure 6.5a). Further, in background traﬃc, although the best lowering of packet loss was produced by FAHP-SAW (see table 5.4), the best scheme that minimized the packet loss rate was in fact FAHP-VIKOR (see ﬁgure 5.8).

Accordingly, in order to choose the most suitable method minimizing delay time and packet loss, in a certain type of traﬃc, a comparison from an application point of view is conducted.

Conversational Trafﬁc: The applications belonging to this class are characterized by the fact that the transfer time should be low due to the conversational nature of the traﬃc and at the same time the variation of the time between the information entities in the stream should be preserved In the same way as for real-time streams 3GPP (2017). Thus, there is no room for the cases of packet loss that generate the retransmission process. Figures 5.9 and 5.10, display the performances of fuzzy versions of the schemes in Conversational traﬃc.
In ﬁgures 5.9, a functional diﬀerence between the delay depiction in a voice call application for all schemes is highlighted. From the color scale, it is clear that the schemes producing the least delays are SAW and VIKOR, albeit, performances of SAW drop at the end of the simulation.

Figure 5.9: Delay Performance over Time in Conversational Traﬃc using FAHP.
Figure 5.10, exhibits the contrast between the representation of the total packet loss rates in a voice call application for all the schemes. Plainly, the scheme delivering the lowest packet loss rate is VIKOR.

Streaming Trafﬁc: When the user is looking at real time video streaming, the constraints of real time insight applies. This concept is one of the newcomers to data communication, which raises a number of new requirements in telecommunication and data communication systems. It is characterized in that the temporal relationships (variation) between the information entities (ie the samples, the packets) in a stream must be preserved 3GPP (2017) Figures 5.11 and 5.12, feature the performances of fuzzy versions of the schemes in Streaming traﬃc.

the four schemes. The only method reaching the lowest delay, as exposed by the color bar, is VIKOR.

Likewise, in ﬁgure 5.12, the packet loss rates of the four schemes are put on display. Even-though SAW reaches the low-most packet loss at the beginning of the simulation, but the total packet loss rate of VIKOR scheme is the lowest.

Figure 5.12: Packet Loss Performance over Time in Streaming Traﬃc using FAHP.
Interactive Trafﬁc: Interactive traﬃc is a communication ﬂow that is deﬁned by the end-user request response model. The round trip delay is the most important attribute for this class. Another important attribute is that the error rate should be very low in the data transfer 3GPP (2017). Figures 5.13 and 5.14, exhibit the performances of fuzzy versions of the schemes in Interactive traﬃc.

Uncommonly to the other applications, MEW scheme settled the under-most delay all along the simulation time, as established by the color bar. In ﬁgure 5.14, the packet loss rates of the fuzzy schemes are paraded. SAW scored a narrow packet loss during the time of simulation.

Background Trafﬁc: In this class where applications run in the background, communication sleeps and wakes up when an email arrives. It is deﬁned by the fact that the destination does not expect data in a certain time however it compels that the content must be delivered with a low error rate. Figures 5.15 and 5.16, emphasize the performances of fuzzy versions of the schemes in Background traﬃc.

Figure 5.15 underlines the delay performances of the fuzzy schemes of a emailing application. All the schemes hold the same delay level during the time of the simulation, apart from SAW which stretches to the utmost of background delays. However VIKOR provides the least delay comparing with the other schemes.

Figure 5.15: Delay Performance over Time in Background Traﬃc using FAHP.
In ﬁgure 5.16, the packet loss rates of the fuzzy schemes are exposed. Admitting that MEW exhibits the lowest packet loss at the beginning of the simulation, the sum packet loss rate of VIKOR scheme during the time of the simulation is the lowest of all the schemes.

5.3.2 Utility Function Scheme Performance Evaluation
5.3.2.1 Utility-based Scheme in Heterogeneous Networks
We handle the experiments, in this section, to validate the approach using utility-function, by analysing the impact of speed velocity on QoS. We analyse thereby the velocity speed by varying it: 20 m/s, 30 m/s and 40 m/s.
Figure 5.17 illustrates the behaviour of delay over time, it compares the performance of our scheme while varying the velocity speed. in terms of delay, its shows that the proposed scheme produces very good results at low 20 m/sec, medium 30 m/sec mobile user speed and allowable performance for high speed of 40 m/sec still better by 7% than the baseline scheme simulated with only 10 m/sec (see table below 5.6).

The swiftness of the decisions made by the terminal to utility values inﬂuences also on the number of packets dropped all along the simulation. For packet loss, the proposed scheme provides an acceptable packet loss for all types of application. Compared to the baseline, our proposed scheme reduces the packet by 40%.

5.3.2.2 Utility-based Scheme in Heterogeneous LTE

To evaluate our proposed scheme, we conducted simulation experiments for both UE driven handover and eNB triggered one, the obtained results are compared. Table 5.7 presents the detailed parameters considered in the scenario inspired from RAN (2009). In this scenario, UEs are randomly dispersed around the sites and attached to the network automatically. Simulations last 50 seconds, so UEs would have travelled far enough to trigger some handovers. In all simulations, we use a network consisting of Macrocells and Femtocells. UE nodes follow the same mobility model we managed to make users roam randomly between diﬀerent cells as presented in table 5.7.

DL and UL Throughputs An adequate handover scheme is that which establishes high throughput although UEs are in high speed mobility. Thereby, we consider the throughput for the three velocities all along the simulation time. Figure 5.19 shows the downlink and uplink throughputs over the simulation time. the downlink throughput of our proposed scheme is almost equal in medium and high speed. The uplink throughput in low speed scenario is highest. In addition, the proposed cell selection scheme performs better downlink and uplink throughputs higher than that of the cell selection triggered by eNB for all speed scenarios.

DL and UL Delays For sensitive application like video streaming, the shortest end-to-end delay, the better the application performance. Thus, in our scenarios we compute the average end-to-end delay for the three velocities. The results are presented in ﬁgure 5.20, it shows the average delay for downlink and uplink. Results show that UE Triggered scheme provides the lowest end-to-end delay in diﬀerent speeds for both downlink and uplink ﬂows. This is due to the good performance of our proposed scheme in terms of number of handover.

DL and UL Packet Loss Rates Concerning Packet Loss Rate, it is used to evaluate the network reliability, and is deﬁned as the total number of lost data packets divided by the total number of transmitted data packets. We compute the packet loss rate of the three considered velocities, results shown in ﬁgure 5.21 describes the packet loss rate for downlink and uplink, the proposed scheme has the lowest error rate for all the traﬃc speeds.

Figure 5.22: Average Number of Handover per Second using User-Driven Handover Scheme in LTE Macro/Femto Cells in Streaming traﬃc.
Average Number of Handovers The ping-pong handover is a very frequent anomaly in the mobile networks, which can cause ineﬃciency, call dropping and degrading of the network performance. The ping-pong handover in LTE means two consecutive handovers between the source and the target eNBs and vice versa. Coverage parameters, user location area and its mobility and speed are the main causes of ping-pong. The ping-pong eﬀect takes place by dint of the frequent movement of UE between the source and the target eNB, or high signal ﬂuctuation at the common boundary of the eNBs. The ping-pong movement in LTE is one of the most crucial problems which reduce the quality of the connection and degrade the performance of the handover. Since the limitation of ping-pong eﬀect is a mandatory task and considering the high speed scenario we adopt, we consider the number of handover as an important metric to prove the eﬀectiveness of our scheme. In ﬁgure 5.19, we calculated the average number of handovers handled per second. Obviously, the UE triggered selection performs less handovers comparing by the eNB triggered cell selection. The proposed scheme reduces the number of unnecessary handover. Moreover, the speed of nodes has an impact on the number of handover. UE triggered a handover only if needed. Thus, if the current connected cell still reply to the QoS requirements, handover does not take a place, even if a better cell exists.
5.3.3 Matching Scheme Performance Evaluation

User satisfaction, which depends on the QoS perceived by each application, is an important factor for successful access point selection, it will make it much easier for an UE to roam from one AP to another, within a single or multiple cooperating providers. Thus, in the ﬁrst comparison, we consider the time delay and packet loss rate over time in each type of traﬃc. In the second comparison, we dissect the throughput and number of handover while increasing the number of users.
5.3.3.1 Scenario 1
Our proposed algorithm consist of a QoS aware access point selection expressed by the QoS metrics considered during the decision and a context aware approach that integrate the type of traﬃc used by the mobile user in the decision of the next handed network by generating a set of weights for each type of traﬃc. Therefore, in the ﬁrst scenario, we fairly compare the performance of proposed algorithm with a simple weighting Drissi and Oumsis (2015a), a fuzzy weighting Drissi et al. (2016b) and a QoS-based schemes Drissi et al. (2017a) over time and the results are presented for each type of traﬃc.
As depicted in Figure 5.23, access point selection based on matching algorithm represents the best way for avoiding the degradation of the delay time in the network due to the time cost of running the algorithms. As well, our solution oﬀers an optimized selection for ensuring a load balanced network and improving, thereby, a long-term performance for upcoming users. Indeed, in diﬀerent types of traﬃc, the proposed solution is the one in which the delay declines the most, whereas the simple weighting scheme provides an almost steady delay, the fuzzy weighting scheme does not hold up over time as the delay increase ﬁrmly. While the delay in QoS based utility does decrease but not suﬃciently compared with the proposed solution.

Figure 5.24 shows the average packet loss rate over time in network. The average packet loss within the proposed matching users and access points based on QoS and the user’s context scheme achieves the accurate packet loss level in diﬀerent types of traﬃc and yields a noteworthy performance gains. The packet loss rate provided by the proposed solution represents a very slow rise, but still way too decreased related to the other schemes.

5.3.3.2 Scenario 2
In a second scenario, we compare the performance of the proposed scheme with the Max-SINR user association (which is the original scheme used by each user to connect to the suitable access point Andrews et al. (2014)) and Max-Throughput scheme Aryafar et al. (2013). Yet, in heterogeneous environment, such association of users to diﬀerent access points will unbalance and direct the traﬃc to the AP that provide the best SINR or Throughput, by dint of ignoring the other QoS parameters during the process of selection in the overlapped zones. A suitable association scheme is a scheme which establishes high throughput for all EUs despite their greediness. Thereby, we consider the throughput as a function of number of users. Figure 5.25a shows the sum throughput while varying the UEs numbers. We compare the proposed matching with Max-SINR and Max-Throughput schemes. The proposed matching scheme

number of users.

Figure 5.25: (a) Empirical Sum Throughput and (b) Average Number of Handover per Second as a function of number of users, under the proposed algorithm compared with Max-SINR and Max-Throughput schemes.

The ping-pong is a very commonplace aberration and one of the most frequent problems in the context of heterogeneous networks. It can lead to call dropping and unwanted handovers, thereby, lowering the network performance. The ping-pong handover in heterogeneous network means two successive handovers between the source and the target APs and vice versa. Thus, we consider the number of handover in the comparison to show the leverage of the proposed scheme. In ﬁgure 5.25b, the average number of handovers as function of the number of users is depicted. Patently, the proposed scheme performs less handovers comparing with Max-SINR and Max-Throughput schemes. The proposed scheme reduces the number of superﬂuous handovers. The proposed scheme trigger handover only if needed.

5.3.4 Discussion
With improvement in both delay and packet loss rate, in the ﬁrst contribution, FAHP granted a network selection decision that enabled a ubiquitous vertical handover. FAHP provided weights that enabled a fast and intelligent vertical handover considering the time taken by the terminal to calculate the score of each decision. FAHP weights enabled also a seamless vertical handover considering the number of packet dropped during the handover execution. The results of the comparison conducted for this contribution, showed that both SAW and MEW approaches were more suitable for web browsing, while VIKOR was more favourable for voice, video and emailing. The FAHP-VIKOR algorithm produced the least delay and packet loss rates for the four applications except for Interactive applications where VIKOR performed less than SAW in terms of delay and less than MEW algorithm in terms of packet loss rate. Although the SAW method is trivial and simpler to implement among all existing MADM methods, it has several disadvantages such as the compensation for cost criteria by performance criteria. This compensation makes it possible to mask the weaknesses of a QoS metric, which can have adverse consequences in the decision-making phase. For example, for the vertical handover problem, the weighted sum method can

5.3. EVALUATION RESULTS

89

choose a network that does not meet user requirements in terms of quality of service. Also, its lack of precision in identifying the ranking of alternatives is another disadvantage. If its accuracy is high (low diﬀerence between ranking values), it makes it easy to identify the ranking order and to easily select the best alternative. The MEW method has the same advantages and disadvantages as the SAW method. Another criticism to MEW is around penalizing alternatives that have bad values for their attributes. Among MADM methods, the great contribution of TOPSIS besides its easy application is its introduction of the ideal and anti-ideal notions. However, certain limitations characterize this method such as the criteria that must be a cardinal form, or the number of handover and unnecessary handover, which are high, and the Rank Reversal: this phenomenon characterizes the majority of MADM methods and more particularly TOPSIS method. This anomaly means that the ranking order is changing overtime when new alternatives (or criteria) are added or deleted. Yet, TOPSIS must not be eliminated since its ideal and anti-ideal alternatives are used by VIKOR and among its strong factors in ﬁnding the compromised ranking. Noting that in three out of four applications VIKOR selected the network with the lowest delays and packets lost rates during the handover.

In the ﬁrst work, the vertical handover was handled without mobile users speed nor the network overloading condition, which could occur in the rare case of large number of terminals and application using the proposed framework and competing on the same network. Those limitations were faced by the second and third proposed algorithms, where a novel utility based network selection was proposed and then enhanced using matching game theory in the purpose of balancing the load on the available networks. The evaluation of the second algorithm showed that the more the speed increase, the less the algorithm performs. Yet, the proposed scheme is advantageous for high data rate applications for a speed up to 40 m/sec. It reduces the delay and packet loss ratio, and consequently improves QoS comparing with SAW scheme with a low speed of 10 m/sec comparing to the previously proposed algorithm. The same approach was customized for heterogeneous LTE cells, in-which Femtocells deployment covers a wide range of environments in public areas such as enterprise buildings, airports, shopping malls and highways. For this scenario, where the open access mode is used, the performance evaluation and comparison of UE triggered cell selection and eNB triggered one in environment that contains macrocells and femtocells was compared. In low, medium and high speed scenarios, the use of UE triggered handover against eNB triggered one improves the QoS of downlink and uplink in terms of throughput, delay, packet loss rate and number of handovers. As squaring up to problem of the overloading network, the matching algorithm, indeed, reduced the delays and packet loss rate comparing with the previously proposed algorithms for all types of applications. It shortens the delay and packet loss rate by 19% and 35% respectively. It reveals also that the proposed scheme provides a higher throughput, avoid needless handovers comparing to some literature works and wherefore revamps the QoS.

5.4 Conclusion

CHAPTER 5. APPLICATION FOR HETEROGENEOUS NETWORK IN MOBILE SCENARIOS

In wireless heterogeneous networks, the compulsory QoS perceived by users and aﬀordable from operators can be attained through an ubiquitous vertical handover that fuses the mobile users prerequisite and networks capacities. In order to reach the required QoS for all types of traﬃc and avoid service discontinuity in heterogeneous networks, we implemented and compared, in this chapter, the Multi-Criteria Decision Framework for Network Selection over LTE and Wi-Fi for an ubiquitous and real time network selection based on MADM, Utility Function and Matching game.
In the ﬁrst approach, the fuzzy enhancement made to AHP coupled with four ranking Methods, ie TOPSIS, VIKOR, MEW and SAW has proven its eﬀectiveness. FAHP is used to produce the fuzzy weights in favour of ranking the candidate networks regarding the multi criteria concept. The fuzzy improvement enables to raise the QoS in all types of traﬃc, comparing with the use of classical AHP weights. It is due to the fact that the choice of the selected network is not distorted by the human intervention. Indeed Simulation experiments with Network Simulator NS3 showed that the use of FAHP weights achieves a momentous enhancement of the quality of QoS with all MADM methods. Thus, FAHP can decrease packet loss and end-to-end delay in all types of traﬃcs. Furthermore, we suggested for each type of traﬃc, the most suitable scheme that minimize Delay and Packet Loss Rate. The perspective of this work can be conducted by running more sophisticated simulations and test-beds in a real heterogeneous environment.
In the second approach , we proposed a context-aware scheme of network selection based on utility function and considers both mobile user’s needs and provider’s constraints. The selection decision function is deﬁned as a utility function consisting of QoS parameters. We have considered four real time applications. Simulation results showed that the proposed scheme is advantageous for high data rate applications even if user move with the high speed of 40 m/sec. It reduces the delay and packet loss ratio, and consequently improves QoS.
Finally, the third approach, we proposed a QoS -aware and context-aware scheme of network selection based on matching theory which considers both mobile user’s needs and provider’s hindrances. The decision operation inﬂicts the agreement of both sides. Indeed, the matching of UEs to APs considers preferences lists based on utility function on the network side, consisting of four QoS metrics, i.e., throughput, delay, jitter and bit error rate. Whilst, on the user side, a set of weights are generated to express the context awareness of the type of application used by each user. The UEs/APs matching algorithm is implemented in a topology of Wi-Fi/LTE heterogeneous network alongside the baseline schemes. Simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme is propitious for all types of applications. It shortens the delay and packet loss rate by 19% and 35% respectively, provides a higher throughput, avoid needless handovers and wherefore revamps the QoS.
In this simulation campaign, the small sample size is a limitation. Yet, all network simulations can

only approximate the behaviour of a real system with speciﬁc characteristics. Thus, the grand challenge of this paper is using simulation experiments to reach credible comparisons and conclusions so that can be relatively correlated to larger networks. Thus, in next chapter, eﬀorts are deployed to consider more sophisticated simulations in a large scale topology in a real heterogeneous vehicular environment.

6.1 Introduction
In high-speed scenarios, such as in the V2X network as shown in ﬁgure 6.1, a critical problem that aﬀects the QoS of a certain service is the next-handed network selection. Thus, we focus our work in the second phase of handover procedure. The decision function is set as a multi criteria utility function which considers three use case related parameters, namely: e2e latency, reliability, and data rate. We have considered four V2X applications.

CHAPTER 6. APPLICATION FOR HETEROGENEOUS VEHICULAR NETWORK IN V2X SCENARIO

Figure 6.1: Illustration of Using LTE Bearers for V2X communications.
In the handover initiation, while being connected to a certain cell, the vehicle performs neighbour cells measurements and utilities calculations and compares the obtained outcomes with the the utility of the current network. In case of a better alternative, the vehicle triggers handover to the network.
In order to catch the content level of a vehicle, we assess the normalized content of vehicle considering e2e latency, reliability, and data rate of the neighbouring networks including the serving network. Thus, the utility should be high and the decision is made accordingly.
We used, thereby, the previously proposed algorithm that computes the optimal stable matching entailing the assignment of all vehicles to the most suitable network regarding the type of the service each vehicle requires. The proposed approach prioritizes networks with higher relevance to diﬀerent use cases and enables seamless connectivity to vehicles. Simulations results are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in high mobility V2X scenarios compared with the existing baseline scheme.
6.2 Network Conﬁguration et Simulation Parameters
6.2.1 Network Topology
To evaluate the proposed Handovers for vehicular networks, We performed a set of simulation experiments over a realistic urban environment in the city of Seattle, Washington Wang et al. (2015), we used three diﬀerent tools to collaborate harmoniously. Hence, the covered area of interest is captured from the OpenStreetMap tool Haklay and Weber (2008) as depicted in Figure 6.2a, then the SUMO tool Krajzewicz et al. (2012) is used to generate the vehicles’ routes and movement patterns as shown ﬁgure 6.2c to be used ﬁnally by NS-3 network simulator Riley and Henderson (2010) as a mobility model.

6.2.3 Network Deplyement

The experiments are operating the proposed schemes apace with the Max-SINR user association (which is the original scheme used by each user to connect to the suitable access point Andrews et al. (2014)) and Max-Throughput scheme Aryafar et al. (2013), under the same network conﬁguration, whereby 41 femto LTE base stations, of radius 500 m and 6 macro LTE cells,of 1000 m radius are deployed using the network simulator 3 (NS-3) Riley and Henderson (2010). The LTE cells are distributed as shown in ﬁgure 6.3 in 6000 − By − 7000 m2 area. The behaviours of QoS metrics considered by the schemes are calculated, in this paper, using the built-in FlowMonitor NS-3 tool that tracks per-ﬂow statistics at the IP layer including throughput and latency and reliability.

Throughout the simulations, the decision of the next handed network is a function of e2e latency, reliability, and data rate, As reported in table 6.2 below.

6.3 Evaluation Criteria

The objective of the experiments is to analyse and compare the eﬀectiveness of proposed selection. To this end, we analyse the QoS metrics, delay, packet delivery and throughput, inasmuch as those QoS metrics translate the satisfaction of greedy mobile users. In addition, delay and packet delivery change constantly over the simulation each time the selection process is called. On one hand, delay is concerned by the time taken by the algorithm to converge which involves the time from the sending and receiving a packet by the source to the destination. On the other hand, a certain number of packets are lost during the vertical handover execution which has an inﬂuence on the Packet Delivery Ratio in addition to the throughput that increase with the increasing number of vehicles. All results are obtained by averaging over a large number of independent simulation runs.
 Delay: is the time elapsing from the sending of a packet by the source until it is received by the destination.
 Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR): is deﬁned as the ratio of data packets received by the destinations to those generated by the sources.
 Throughput: is the number of messages successfully delivered per unit time.
The following section details the development of the network throughout the simulation.

6.4 Evaluation Results
The performance result of the previously proposed matching algorithm along side with the most popular network selection algorithms, Max-SINR and Max-Throughput Andrews et al. (2014) Aryafar et al. (2013) respectively are detailed in terms of Throughput, latency and reliability.

(b) Empirical CDF of Throughput.

Figures 6.4a and 6.4b present the eﬀects of traﬃc density on throughput using the proposed algorithm along side with the max-throughput and max-sinr algorithms. The proposed approach shows about an average of 20% gain in throughput over the max-throughput scheme and 20% over the max-sinr scheme. This smaller gain occurs because handovers only make up a small portion of the total time in which a vehicle receives packets. It is also observed that throughput performance begins improving at a lower vehicle density. The probability results 6.4b in 600 vehicles show that max-sinr’ throughput probability is lowest, this is due to the occurrence of packet collision before saturation is reached, which only has a noticeable eﬀect on throughput. Further deterioration in max-throughput is observed, as the bad choice of selected network causes an increase in the collision rate. The proposed method in 600 vehicle topology again shows a better possibilities of a good performance.

(b) Empirical CDF of Delay.

Figure 6.5: (a) Average Delay in seconds per Number of vehicles and (b) Empirical CDF of Delay ( 600 Vehicles).

In ﬁgure 6.5a and 6.5b, we analyse the impact of traﬃc density on the diﬀerent algorithms. Figure 6.5a presents the eﬀect of traﬃc density on latency, in the urban environment. As expected, the delay performance closely mirrors the throughput results, but shows smaller diﬀerences between approaches. The latency values are consistent until the networks begin reaching full saturation at about 500 vehicles, when high collision rates and longer network access times occur. Above 200 vehicles, we observe a 350 ms latency increase for the proposed approach, a 450 ms increase for max-throughput, and a 500 ms increase for max-sinr algorithms. Traﬃc density aﬀects max-throughput and max-sinr algorithms latency the most, due to their bas cell selection during the handover; The proposed handover maintains the most consistency because it removes the ping-pong packet exchange that otherwise occurs during the handover, reducing the costs of collision rates and network access times. Figure 6.5b illustrates the results when 600 vehicle are deployed. Here, the probability of reaching highest delay belongs to max-sinr algorithm, followed by max-throughput. The proposed algorithms presents the lowest probabilities in reaching lowest delay in a dens topology.

(a) Average PDR (%)

(b) Empirical CDF of PDR.

Figure 6.6: (a) Average PDR per Number of vehicles and (b) Empirical CDF of PDR( 600 Vehicles).

The goal of establishing simulation is to assess the quality of communication which can be quantiﬁed through the measurement of PDR. The applications streams are encoded in packets which are transmitted through the selected interface. Figure 6.6a and 6.6b show the results of average packet delivery ratio for diﬀerent types of application for over various loads. The packets sent, when running the proposed algorithm, present a high success rate, especially for a small number of vehicles. For Max-Throughput algorithm, lower PDR was observed at larger topologies between the ﬂow source and the destination. Nevertheless, the PDR is above 80% in most of the experiments. In the obstructed line-of-sight scenarios caused by vehicles and buildings, the PDR decreases as the number of vehicles increases. The foremost reason is that signal undergoes attenuation caused by simultaneous connections. The MaxSINR algorithm presents a lowest packet delivery ratio. The impact of the cell selection is quite visible in the quality of the radio link and consequently in PDR. Figure 6.6b illustrates the results when 600 vehicle are deployed. Here, the probability of reaching lowest reliability belongs to max-sinr algorithm, followed by max-throughput. The proposed algorithms presents the highest probabilities in reaching highest reliability in a dense topology.

6.4.4 Discussion
In future ITS, the vehicular network is the basic infrastructure and plays a critical role. The vehicular communications have broad market and attracted more attentions recently. In this chapter, the previously proposed load balanced network selection is proposed as an integrated solution for V2X communications based LTE-V2X deployment. Compared with the most popular algorithms, Max-Throughput and MaxSINR, the proposed algorithm presents an enhancement in terms of latency, throughput and reliability. In addition, the LTE-V2X topology inherits the advantages of LTE including natively high mobility support,

high capacity, and ﬂexible spectrum distribution. Moreover, LTE-V2X have to develop new features to meet the challenges for V2V communications, such as congestion control with heavy density traﬃc and low cost broadcasting. The standardization of LTE-V2X has to be harmonized and collaborated with organizations and alliances. Since LTE is the mainstream 4G mobile communication technology and with large industrial foundation, LTE-V2X can exploit economies of scale and with a short time to market. By levering the technology research and industry of LTE with stakeholders and through the cross-industry cooperation, LTE-V2X will be actively promoted in the standard body and industry.

6.5 Conclusion
In this section, we introduced a novel architecture that integrates LTE networks with vehicular scenarios. In this architecture, a cell is selected to connect ordinary vehicles with the LTE network. throughput, reliability and latency of cells are all taken into consideration when clustering vehicles and selecting vehicle cells. Cell discovery and handover scenarios are also considered and adequate solutions are presented. The envisioned LTE for V2X network is expected to prevent frequent handovers at LTE base stations. By using this topology, all vehicles can access fairy the network. On other hand, by implementing the previously proposed matching algorithm, bottlenecks and congestion across the path towards a single cell can be eliminated.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS
In this chapter, we summarize our major contributions and discuss future research directions.
Conclusions
Next generation networks are expected to be dense, complex and heterogeneous. Therefore, the need of new vertical handover schemes happen to be the most eﬃcient solution for a seamless connectivity. This work aims investigating the fundamental beneﬁts of deploying a multi-criteria network selection algorithm in heterogeneous network from two aspects: network selection proposition and performance study. Three algorithms have been proposed for the general case of heterogeneous networks, whereas the performance study has been evaluated for two scenario types: Cellular and Vehicular. Speciﬁcally, the main contributions can be summarized as follows.
The network selection proposition aspect of this thesis was sectioned in two approaches:  Framework for Multi-Criteria Network Selection based on MADM.
We ﬁrst detailed the mathematical modelling of MADM methods used in our proposed model. Then, we described the architecture of our selection algorithm, which is levering a combination of multi-criteria decision making methods to ensure that appropriate network is selected for a certain type of traﬃc and considering a number of QoS metrics that due to their interdependency, a weight distribution phase is required. The framework has been implemented in two variants of weighting distribution algorithms AHP, and FAHP. To ascertain thoroughly the weights of QoS metrics impacting the decision for each application, AHP is generally applied. But its classical form comes with biased rules that are dealt with through an enhanced version FAHP that has proven its performance when combined with the other well reputed ranking methods, namely: MEW,SAW, TOPSIS and VIKOR. We explained the functioning of each variant and present some limitation of the contribution.  Load Balanced Network Selection Algorithm in High Speed Heterogeneous Networks. In the ﬁrst work, the vertical handover was handled without mobile users speed nor the network overloading condition. Those limitations were squaring up by the second and third proposed algorithms, where a novel utility based network selection was proposed and then enhanced using matching game theory in the purpose of balancing the load on the available networks.

104

Conclusions and Future Works

The second approach is the utility function for high speed scenarios. For network selection decision, utility function assigned to the satisfaction that a network provides to mobile users. Diﬀerent available networks with diﬀerent user preferences will have diﬀerent utility values. We proposed a context-aware access network selection based on utility function that takes into consideration user’s and QoS preferences. It aims at maximizing the user satisfaction while meeting application QoS when connecting to a target network. The proposed approach prioritizes networks with higher relevance to diﬀerent types of applications and enables seamless connectivity to mobile user and applications. Thus, network resources are conveniently managed to support diverse services that might be considered by mobile users.
This approach was enhanced using the matching game theory, a winning the 2012 Nobel Prize, which provides a mathematically tractable method for personnel assignment problem in two distinct sets. In wireless networks, the matching was applied for mobile users and access points. We enhanced the latter solution by proposing an network selection scheme that provides a load balancing technique based on matching theory. This scheme focuses on enabling simultaneous invocation of applications with diﬀerent traﬃc and QoS characteristics. We formulated, thereby, our problem as a matching game, aiming to meet the required QoS of cellular users, randomly distributed in heterogeneous networks coverage, then we proposed an algorithm that computes the optimal stable matching entailing the assignment of all users to the most suitable network regarding the type of the service each user need in high speed environment.
In the performance evaluation aspect, two scenarios have been adopted. Cellular and Vehicular scenarios:
 Performance Evaluation of the proposed schemes in Cellular network. The three algorithms were evaluated to the purpose of proving their applicabilities in a mobile environments considering Cellular application namely, Conversational, Streaming, Interactive and Background for a ubiquitous and real time Network Selection over LTE and WLAN.
In MADM scheme evaluation, The fuzzy improvement enabled QoS enhancement in all types of traﬃc, compared to AHP weights. The use of FAHP contributed to a decrease in packet loss rate and end-to-end delay in all types of traﬃcs. Indeed Simulation experiments with Network Simulator NS3 showed that the use of FAHP weights achieves a momentous enhancement of the quality of QoS with all MADM methods. Thus, FAHP can decrease packet loss and end-to-end delay in all types of traﬃcs. Furthermore, we suggested for each type of traﬃc, the most suitable scheme that minimize Delay and Packet Loss Rate.
In addition, the utility scheme, where the selection decision function is deﬁned as a utility function consisting of QoS parameters, was evaluated in low, medium and high mobility scenarios compared with the previous baseline scheme. Simulation results showed that the proposed scheme is advantageous for high data rate applications even if user move with the high speed of 40 m/sec. It reduces the delay and packet loss ratio, and consequently improves QoS.

Finally, the matching enhancement was implemented in a topology of Wi-Fi/LTE heterogeneous network alongside the previous schemes. Simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme is propitious for all types of applications. It shortens the delay and packet loss rate by 19% and 35% respectively, provides a higher throughput, avoid needless handovers and wherefore revamps the QoS.
 Performance Evaluation of the proposed schemes in Vehicular network. In high-speed scenarios such as the V2X, the network selection dedicated to 5G systems in V2X Scenarios is more critical. Thus, the previously proposed matching algorithm was performed in vehicular scenario where four V2X application were implemented such as: Advanced Driving, Remote driving, Platooning and Extended Sensor. The performance evaluation was implemented in a large scale topology. Results show that the proposed algorithm is more accurate compared to baseline algorithms for vehicular applications.

Future Works
There are several research directions in which the work can be extended.

Conclusions and Future Works

Short-term Perspective Work
Multi-Path Stream Over Heterogeneous Networks: In the coexistence of variety of network technologies, it is interesting for a mobile user to use more than one channel to send data instead of having to choose one access point. We are actually studying the possibility of Multi-Path networks selection for a user to reduce the application delay, connection time and guarantee the quality of the user experience (QoE). In this context, the new architecture would support the QoE.
Vanets-LTE Coexistence: V2X communications technology is expected to revolutionize the ground transportation system by providing a safer, smarter, less polluted, and more entertaining environment for people on roads. To support V2X applications for a large number of vehicles, interworking between Vanets and cellular network technologies is a promising approach.
Handover Triggering: In this work, the vertical handover in heterogeneous environment is handled without considering handover triggering techniques, purposefully, to be able to highlight the potentials of the schemes in real time under a vying conditions, however, this could subdue the handover process in a real environment. In the future works, eﬀorts will be deployed to consider handover triggering in the network selection process.

Long-term Perspective Work
A mobile Access Point: Throughout this thesis, we considered a stationary base stations. However, an interesting idea is to use the public transportations and their mobility to deploy the access points. Public transportations usually move along a ﬁxed route track, it means that it is possible to predict the moving direction of mobile relays. This moving network also comes with challenging problems in terms of mobility management. To study how mobility aﬀects the system performance and handover rate, it would be interesting to study this evolving technology.
5G Interesting topics Among others, my research interest topics lie on Device to Device (D2D) communications, MillimetreWaves (mmWaves) and Full Duplex, which aim to meet requirements of 5G networks. In fact, distribution

of users is important in future wireless networks. Using load balancing tools are primary to analyse and derive performance of next generation technologies:
 In D2D communications, users can communicate directly or act as relay to forward the traﬃc of other users to the nearest base stations. This can improve spectrum utilization, overall throughput, and energy eﬃciency while enabling new peer-to-peer and location-based applications and services. In this direction, eﬀorts can be directed in studying issues including: Energy eﬃciency, Resource allocation and Spectrum sharing between cellular and D2D users.
 Due to potential of availability of wider bandwidths, the mmWaves bands above 30 GHz hold promise for providing high peak data rates in speciﬁc areas where traﬃc demands are very high. Many interesting aspects can be tackled such as evaluation of the coverage and the rate of mmWaves systems and developing new channel models.
 Full Duplex, currently, the 5G network has become a keyword among researchers and engineers in the communication society. As a candidate of 5G technologies, full duplex has been received great attention and discussed a lot. Full duplex wireless system can maximally achieve doubled spectral eﬃciency by transmitting and receiving signals at the same time and frequency. Due to advances in both radio and digital processing, full duplex can now be implemented at reasonable cost and without complex radio hardware.

APPENDIX: NETWORK SIMULATOR 3
About NS-3 Riley and Henderson (2010)
NS3 has been developed to provide an open, extensible network simulation platform, for networking research and education. In brief, NS3 provides models of how packet data networks work and perform, and provides a simulation engine for users to conduct simulation experiments. Among the reasons for which we have used NS3 is the fact that it perform studies that are more diﬃcult or not possible to perform with real systems, to study system behaviour in a highly controlled, reproducible environment. The available model set in NS3 focuses on modelling how Internet protocols and networks work. Many simulation tools exist for network simulation studies. The feature of NS3 in contrast to other tools is that NS3 is designed as a set of libraries that can be combined together and also with other external software libraries. While some simulation platforms provide users with a single, integrated graphical user interface environment in which all tasks are carried out, NS3 is more modular in this regard. Several external animators and data analysis and visualization tools can be used with NS3. However, NS3 is used at the command line and with C++ and/or Python software development tools.
FlowMonitor Module The Flow Monitor module goal is to provide a ﬂexible system to measure the performance of network protocols. The module uses probes, installed in network nodes, to track the packets exchanged by the nodes, and it will measure a number of parameters. Packets are divided according to the ﬂow they belong to, where each ﬂow is deﬁned according to the probes characteristics (e.g., for IP, a ﬂow is deﬁned as the packets with the same protocol, source (IP, port), destination (IP, port) tuple.

112

Appendix

The statistics are collected for each ﬂow can be exported in XML format. Moreover, the user can access the probes directly to request speciﬁc statistics about each ﬂow.

Mobility Module
In ns-3, special Mobility Model objects track the evolution of position with respect to a (Cartesian) coordinate system. The mobility model is typically aggregated to an node. There is a diﬀerent motion behaviours the node can follow.
The initial position of objects is typically set with a Position Allocator. These types of objects will lay out the position on a notional canvas. Once the simulation starts, the position allocator may no longer be used, or it may be used to pick future mobility ”waypoints” for such mobility models.
Most users interact with the mobility system using mobility helper classes. The Mobility Helper combines a mobility model and position allocator, and can be used with a node container to install mobility capability on a set of nodes.

Motivation For NS3 Use
In networking, the most used imulator is with ns-2 (a popular tool that preceded NS3), the most visible outward change when moving to NS3 is the choice of scripting language. Programs in ns-2 are scripted in OTcl and results of simulations can be visualized using the Network Animator nam. It is not possible to run a simulation in ns-2 purely from C++ (i.e., as a main() program without any OTcl). Moreover, some components of ns-2 are written in C++ and others in OTcl. In NS3, the simulator is written entirely in C++, with optional Python bindings. Simulation scripts can therefore be written in C++ or in Python. New animators and visualizers are available and under current development. Since ns-3 generates pcap packet trace ﬁles, other utilities can be used to analyze traces as well. In this tutorial, we will ﬁrst concentrate on scripting directly in C++ and interpreting results via trace ﬁles. But there are similarities as well (both, for example, are based on C++ objects, and some code from ns-2 has already been ported to NS3). The highlight diﬀerences between ns-2 and NS3 consist in:
 It provides features not available in ns-2, such as a implementation code execution environment (allowing users to run real implementation code in the simulator), NGN

Appendix

...

 It provides a lower base level of abstraction compared with ns-2, allowing it to align better with how real systems are put together. Some limitations found in ns-2 (such as supporting multiple types of interfaces on nodes) have been remedied in ns-3.

Ns-2 has a more diverse set of contributed modules than does NS3, owing to its long history. However, NS3 has more detailed models in several popular areas of research (including sophisticated LTE and Wi-Fi models), and its support of implementation code admits a very wide spectrum of high-ﬁdelity models.
