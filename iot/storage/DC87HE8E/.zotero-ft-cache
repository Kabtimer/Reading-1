Abstract—Internet of things (IoT) is considered as the next technological revolution. Therefore, many solutions are developed either in free, i.e. ISM bands or in non free bands with the ultimate aim of affording connectivity over several kilometers. Based on this feature, in urban environment the density of IoT devices will be extremely high. In this paper we propose to analyze the collision and packet loss when LoRaWAN is considered. Based on the LoRaWAN features, we develop closed-form expressions of collision and packet loss probabilities. Simulation results conﬁrm our theoretical developments. We also show that our theoretical expressions are more accurate than the Poisson distributed process to describe the collisions.
I. INTRODUCTION
The Internet of things (IoT) deployment in free bands is mainly based on two communication technologies which are Sigfox [1] and LoRa [2]. Such technologies are called low power wide area network (LPWAN) and they share the same objectives, i.e the establishment of long range, low power and low data rate communications. Despite these similarities, they are technically and economically opposites. Indeed the Sigfox physical layer is based on ultra narrow band communication, whereas LoRa uses a spreading spectrum technique to exchange information. In this paper we focus our attention on LoRa in order to analyze the collision and packet loss when LoRaWAN is considered. Indeed, if we believe to the IoT success in our every day life, it is predictable to have several millions of IoT devices using such modulation techniques. Therefore, the coexistence of all these devices, when the communication is performed using the same range, will threat IoT communication with interferences.
The channel access in LoRaWAN class A is based on an ALOHA principle. For networks using an ALOHA type channel access, many packet collision studies have been done before. The considered system in this paper is different than the one used for classical analysis of packet collision in an un-slotted ALOHA based protocol [3]. Indeed, packet time on air and time between two successive transmissions depend on the IoT application. Thus, the model allowing to describe the collision effect based on Poisson distributed process (PDP) is not accurate enough. However, in our case this modeling is useful to deﬁne lower and upper bounds of the probability of success for a given spreading factor. In this paper we propose a more accurate and speciﬁc approach to predict the collision and packet loss. Thus, based on the LoRaWAN

MAC mechanisms we develop closed-form expressions of the probability of collision and packet loss and our theoretical analyses are conﬁrmed by the simulations.
The paper is organized as follows. In section II the LoRa modulation and the LoRaWAN MAC layer are introduced. In section III we develop the received signal model that we consider. Based on this model, section IV is devoted to the collision and packet loss theoritical analyse. Simulation results are given in section V.

II. LORA AND LORAWAN
The following sections are dedicated to introduce the LoRa physical and MAC layers which is based on the patent [4]. For more details the reader is referred to [5]. It should be noted that the LoRa physical Layer is not published.

A. LoRa physical layer principle

LoRa is based on Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation.

CSS was proposed for the ﬁrst time for communication

systems by Winkler [6] and application to digital communi-

cation by Berni [7]. CSS is considered as a subcategory of

Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum. CSS is compliant with IoT

network needs because it permits to come over the receiver’s

sensitivity issue and increase the communication range at the

cost of a reduced spectral efﬁciency. The spectrum spreading

in LoRa is achieved using a chirp signal that can be described

by its instantaneous phase φ(t) or a speciﬁc time function

fc(t). fc(t) is called the raw chirp that:

• increases linearly, for an up raw chirp, from an initial

value

value

,

• decreases linearly, for a down raw chirp, from an initial

value

B 2

to

a

value

−

B 2

,

where B stands for the ISM signal bandwidth used for the

communication1. The raw chirp time duration is equal to the

symbol period Ts. fc(t) is deﬁned as follows:

B

fc(t) = ± Ts t

(1)

The relationship between the bandwidth and the symbol period

is given by Ts

where SF

stands for the spreading factor

transmitted signal and Db the bit rate, then Ds = Db/SF . Longer range is achieved by varying the spreading factor,

however to meet highly robust communication it is possible

to vary the coding rate.

With LoRa, symbols are obtained from a binary combina-

tion of SF bits. Each symbol is associated to a unique chirp.

The different chirps are orthogonal to each other in order

to retrieve at the receiver the symbols without inter-symbol

interference (IES). If we note M the set of symbols, the chirp

associated to the symbol m, m ∈ [0, M − 1], is obtained by

will be silent, where

dc is the duty cycle.

B. LoRaWAN: a LoRa Mac layer

LoRaWAN is an open standard developed by the LoRa Alliance. It’s one of the possible MAC layer for the LoRa modulation and obviously the well known. The LoRaWAN speciﬁcation deﬁnes 3 categories of nodes:

• Class A: a basic class of LoRa that is implemented in all LoRa chips. It allows bi-directional communications which is usually originally started by the node in an asynchronous way. The uplink transmission triggers two short downlink receive windows. The transmission slot is scheduled when needed by the node in a random time basis. According to LoRaWAN speciﬁcations, class A is an ALOHA based-protocol.
• Class B: this class is conceived to guarantee uplink and downlink separation. Nodes are synchronized using a beacon transmitted by the gateway. Thus, they can receive information from Internet without sending requests.
• Class C: the node has continuously open receive windows that are closed only while transmitting. Compared to A

and B classes, C class consumes more energy to operate but it offers the lowest latency.
The packet time duration is called the time on air. This value depends on several parameters, such SF , B, the size of the payload, the coding rate, etc. After each uplink packet transmission, the node waits for a gateway acknowledgment (ACK) of the correct packet reception. LoRaWAN allows two possible acknowledgments on two different channels. The ﬁrst is transmitted by the gateway with a constant delay of T1 after the end of the uplink packet reception. The gateway uses the same channel than the preceding uplink for this ACK. The second ACK is transmitted on a different channel2 than the uplink after a time T2 > T1 + Togn, where Togn is the time on air of the packet transmitted by the gateway. For more details on the LoRaWAN MAC structure see [6].

III. RECEIVED SIGNAL MODEL

Based on the complex envelope deﬁnition of (2), we express
in this section the model of the received signal that we use. We
consider a system which is composed of one LoRa gateway and N LoRa nodes. The nth node transmit Pn packets, and n(p) represents the packet number p transmitted by the node n with a time on air Tonn.
The bandwidth is narrow enough to make the assumption of ﬂat fading propagation channel. We note hn the channel coefﬁcient associated to the node n. If x(t) is the received
signal at the LoRa gateway, we have:

N

Pn

x(t) = hn rn(t − Tpn)

(3)

n=1 p=1

Let Tpn be the beginning of the LoRa packet p. Based on

this, we deﬁne:
p

Tpn = (p − 1)(Tonn + Tonff ) + Tr(u)

u=0

=

(p

−

1)

Tonn dc

p
+ Tr(u)
u=0

(4)

where Tr(u) is a stationary iid random process with entries uniformly distributed. Tr(u) is used for modeling the
different node constraints in terms of communications with the
gateways. In the following sections we consider that Tr(u) is uniformly distributed in the set [Tmin, Tmax]. This assumption is justiﬁed due to the huge number of IoT applications. Tonn and Tonff are the time on air and time off air, respectively.

IV. COLLISIONS AND PACKET LOSS AT THE LORAWAN
GATEWAY

A. Probability of Collision at the LoRaWAN gateway

In the following we express the probability of collision
between n(p) and n (p ), given that n(p) represents the node of interest. If Cnn((pp) ) denotes this collision, based on (4), the collision event is deﬁned as follows:

Cnn((pp) ) = {Tpn ∈ ΩC = [Tpn − Tonn, Tpn + Tonn]}

2Based on this we focus our attention only on T1.

2656

2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)

A collision between between n(p) and n (p ) will happen if Tpn ∈ ΩC . P Cnn((pp) ) represents the probability of this collision and we have:

P(Cnn((pp) )) = P r Tpn ∈ ΩC

(5)

The random variable Tpn is the summation of multiple uniform

random variables (see (4)). For p >> 1 we suppose, using

the central limit theorem, that T =

p u=0

Tr (u)

is

Gaussian

distributed with a mean

µ

Tmax

(6)

and a variance

σ2

=

(Tmax

(7)

Under this assumption, Tpn is now a summation between two random variables T and Tonn where

T ∼ N (µ, σ2)

(8)

and

Tonn ∼ U (Tomnin, Tomnax)

(9)

Indeed, due to the varity of IoT applications, the time on air
Tonn of the node n can be considered uniformly distributed between the minimal time on air Tomnin and the maximal time on air Tomnax. Based on this, P(Cnn((pp) )) can be rewritten given Tonn as

P(Cnn((pp) ))

(18)

P(Cnn((pp) )) represents the probability of collision between n(p) and n (p ). As we consider n(p) as the node of interest,

a ﬁnite set Ωn (p) of packets p of the node n have a nonnull probability to be in collision with n(p). We note Npn the number of packet of n that can be in collision with n(p).

Thus, the more we increase p , the higher Npn will be. For

n(p), the events Cnn((pp) ) with p ∈ Ωn (p) are disjoint. If we

note Cnn(p) the event associated to the collision of n(p) with

n , we have

Cnn(p) =

Cnn((pp) )

(19)

p ∈Ωn (p)

Thus the probability of collision of n(p) with n is:

P(Cnn(p)) =

P(Cnn((pp) ))

p ∈Ωn (p)

(20)

Numerically, we observed that (20) is independent of p.

This result is interesting because it demonstrates that (20)
is not dependent on the packet number p, consequently it doesn’t depend on the time. Logically P(Cnn(p)) is a function of Tonn, dc and the Tonn spreading in time (i.e the support of the distribution).

Based on (20) we express the probability of at least one collision in an environment composed of N independent

nodes. Thus the probability of having at least one collision between n and the rest of the nodes (using the same SF ) is

given by:

N

Pnc (N ) = 1 −

1 − P(Cnn(p))

(21)

n =1 n =n

B. Packet loss at the LoRaWAN gateway

If no collision occurs on n(p) we consider that the packet
will be acknowledge by the gateway. In this case, after a ﬁxed
delay T1 the LoRaWAN gateway will use the same bandwidth to transmit the ACK. We note Togn the time on air used by the gateway to answer and we suppose that it can be considered as a constant value. During Togn, the gateway is unable to receive a packet. Thus, a packet loss will occurs if a node send an

information during the gateway ACK of n(p). This means that the packet loss of one node depends on the success of another node. Our goal is to express the probability of packet loss of n (p ) based on the success of n(p). This will occur when:

Tpn ∈ ΩL = max(Tpn + Tonn, τ − Tonn), τ + Togn (22)

where τ = Tpn + Tonn + T1, and max(x, y) refers to x if x > y and y otherwise. Based on (22) 3 cases must be considered: case 1 when T1 < Tomnin, case 2 when T1 > Tomnax and case 3 when T1 ∈ [Tomnin, Tomnax]. We deﬁne the probability of packet loss of n (p ) as P Lnn((pp) ) , where Lnn((pp) ) is the
event associated to the n (p ) loss given the success of n(p).

Using the same approach as the one developed in the previous

section, we have : • In case 1:

P Lnn((pp) )
• In case 2:

where Ω1L = [Tpn + Tonn, τ + Togn], Ω2L = [τ − Tonn, τ + Togn], ∆To2n = T1 − Tomnin and ∆To1n = Tomnax − T1. Based on (8) we have:

(28)

Following the same manipulations as the ones from (10) to (18), we can express P Lnn((pp) ) for the 3 previous cases.
Regardless the value of T1, we note Lnn(p) the event associated to the packet loss of n given the success of n(p). Thus

we have:

P Lnn(p) =

P Lnn((pp) )

(29)

p ∈Ωl (p)
n

where Ωln (p) is the set of n (p ) that can be lost given the success of n(p). Thus the probability of packet loss (i.e a

collision with the ACK transmitted by the gateway to n(p))

given the success of n(p) is:





Pnl (N ) = Pns (N ) 1 − N 1 − P Lnn(p) 

(30)

n =1 n =n

where Pns (N ) = 1 − Pnc (N ) is the probability of success of n(p) (i.e no collision).

V. SIMULATION RESULTS

We consider a system which is composed of one gateway that can establish connections with N nodes using the same

spreading factor. We also consider that the signals transmitted by nodes using different SF are orthogonal. The nodes access

the channel randomly in time. The bandwidth is ﬁxed to B = 125kHz and dc = 1%. Tonn is uniformly distributed. The support of his distribution begins from the minimum time

on air to the maximum time on air. These values are reported

in table I and obtained using the online LoRaWAN calculator.

The minimum and maximum number of packet per day are

ﬁxed by the minimum and maximum channel time duration

used, respectively. For our simulations we consider a minimum channel time use of 30s and a maximum of 864s.

First of all, we compare our theoretical results with simula-

tions. Fig. 1 shows the evolution SF = 12 for Tonn = 2s and

of P(Cnn((pp) )) when p = 100, 1s. As it can be seen, our

theoretical results are consistent with the simulations. Indeed,

we verify the accuracy of the theoretical analysis, where both

theoretical expression and simulation curves coincide. In ﬁg. 2
we show the evolution of Pnc (N ). On the one hand we compare our theoretical results with the simulation when Tonn = 1s and 2s. In both cases, simulation and theory are superimposed.

On the other hand, we compare our results with a Poisson

distributed process (PDP) generally use to describe collisions

in such a network and deﬁned as follows:

As we can see when Tonn is closed to the mean value of Tonn,

our approach and the one based on PDP give the same results.

However, when it’s not the case the PDP based approach is not accurate to predict the collision. Indeed, when Tonn = 1s we can see a difference with our results. For example, for Pnc (N ) = 0.3 our theoretical results and also the simulation show that 580 nodes can be managed by the gateway, whereas

the PDP predict 820 nodes.

In ﬁg. 3 we compare the probability of at least one collision

for a payload size between 1 and 59 bytes, when 1000 nodes are considered. These sizes are available for each SF in

LoRaWAN. The results can be grouped in three parts providing the same performance. The ﬁrst is composed of SF = 7 and

In ﬁg. 4 and 5 we show the evolution of Pnl (N ) when SF = 12 and SF = 7, respectively. This allows to show the worst and the best case. For each SF , Togn = Tomnin which corresponds to a ACK composed of 1 byte. We can see that the Pnl (N ) is bounded and pass through a maximum value. From the network point of view only the increasing part of the
curves are interesting. Indeed the decreasing part corresponds

to an important number of collision at the gateway.

VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper we proposed an analysis of packet collision and loss when LoRaWAN is considered. Based on the LoRaWAN features, we developed theoretical expressions for both the collision and the packet loss. These developments have been conﬁrmed by simulations results. We have also showed that our approach allows to more accurately describe the collision than the classical PDP approach. The perspectives of this work are numerous. We are currently working on the theoretical demonstration of the independence of P(Cnn(p)) in p and the development of a software that can predict the interference level of each nodes based on their locations, duty-cycle, time on air, etc. Consider that the nodes with different SF can be non orthogonal is also an interesting perspective of this work.
