Concept
• The Internet of Things is not a single technology, it’s a concept in which most new things are connected and enabled.

Convergence

Challenge
Of the total potential economic value the IoT enables, interoperability is required for 40 % on average and for nearly 60 % in some settings.

Definition

•

“the ability to make systems and

organizations work together”.

•

“the ability of two or more systems

or components to exchange information and

to use the information that has been

exchanged”.

@ckvishwakarma @atcalliance #IoTSG

Seamless
• A technological paradigm or framework without proprietary gates – but with security standards—is hard to imagine today—but so is the seamless connectivity and unprecedented insight IoT promises.
@ckvishwakarma @atcalliance #IoTSG

Connections
• Overcoming the challenge of interoperability may be the single most important hurdle for IoT to reach mass adoption, as it is what enables the boundless ‘connections’ of a connected world.
@ckvishwakarma @atcalliance #IoTSG

Hetrogeneous
• As for the IoT, future networks will continue to be heterogeneous, multivendors, multiservices and largely distributed. Consequently, the risk of non interoperability will increase.
@ckvishwakarma @atcalliance #IoTSG

Interoperability framework
• High–dimensional
– co-existence of many systems (devices, sensors, equipment, etc.) in the environment that need to communicate and exchange information
@ckvishwakarma @atcalliance #IoTSG

Interoperability framework
• Highly-heterogeneous
– lot of manufacturers – targeting diverse application
domains – extremely difficult (if not
impossible) to reach out for global agreements and widely accepted specification.
@ckvishwakarma @atcalliance #IoTSG

Interoperability framework
• Dynamic and non-linear
– New Things (that were not even considered at start) are entering (and leaving) the environment all the time
– Support new unforeseen formats and protocols but that need to communicate and share data in the IoT.
@ckvishwakarma @atcalliance #IoTSG

Interoperability framework
• Hard to describe/model
– Existence of many data formats
– different languages, that can share (or not) the same modelling principles, and that can be interrelated in many ways with one another.
@ckvishwakarma @atcalliance #IoTSG

Customer
• a fragmented environment of proprietary IoT technical implementations will inhibit value for users and industry.
• While full interoperability across products and services is not always feasible or necessary, purchasers may be hesitant to buy IoT products and services if there is integration inflexibility, high ownership complexity, and concern over vendor lock-in.
@ckvishwakarma @atcalliance #IoTSG

Considerations
• Thing Interaction
– there is more than one option to how things will interact with other things or the users.
– situations where interactions with individual things are needed.
– situations where the ability to query and control large groups of things at the same time is also required.
@ckvishwakarma @atcalliance #IoTSG

Considerations
• Virtual Representation of Things
– how things are represented, and described – shared schema or ontology for things
@ckvishwakarma @atcalliance #IoTSG

Considerations
• Searching, Finding and Accessing Things
– Should we be able to search for things by their unique ID, IP, location, name or/and in combination with other properties?
– How can we discover, search, locate or track mobile things that may move from one location or network to another?
– How should things be organized, deployed, managed and secured?
@ckvishwakarma @atcalliance #IoTSG

Considerations
• Syntactic Interoperability between Things
– syntactic interoperability deals with the packaging and transmission mechanisms for data over a network.
– to ensure that data flow is interoperable between the various networks and among a mixture of devices.
– Translation functionalities in networks or in some devices, gateways or in the form of middleware sitting on the edge of a network are most likely needed.
