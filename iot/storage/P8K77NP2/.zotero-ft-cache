IEEE 802.15.4 in ISM 2.4GHz
• Low-power radio in the 2.4GHz band offering 250kbps throughput at physical layer
• Power transmission from 1mW to 100mW for range from 100m to about 1km is LOS
• CSMA/CA • BPSK, used as physical layer
in ZigBee
7

Lower energy means shorter range!
How bad is multi-hop routing?
q Increases packet loss rate q Increases end-to-end delivery time q Consumes more energy as intermediate nodes must relay packets q Limits energy saving mechanism benefits as both sender and
intermediate node must be somehow synchronized q Is impacted by intermediate node failure
8

15 years of multi-hop routing?

- High packet loss rates - Needs synchonization when duty-cycling - Complex deployment, funneling effect

Academics vs Industries Let’s go back to reality!

Millions of sensors, self-organizing, selfconfiguring, with QoS-based multipath routing, mobility, and …

500 sensors, STATIC deployment, but need to have RELIABILITY, GUARANTEED LATENCY for monitoring and alerting. MUST run for 3 YEARS. No fancy stuff! CAN I HAVE IT?

Link budget example
q Received Power (dBm) = Transmitted Power (dBm) + Gains (dB) − Losses (dB) [mainly FSL]
q Example
q Transmitted power is +14dBm (25mw) q Losses is 120dB q Then Receiver Power (dBm) is -106dBm
q If you have a receiver sensitivity of -137dBm you can handle FSPL up to 151dB!
q Rewriting the equation
q Losses (dB) = Transmitted Power (dBm) - Received Power (dBm) q Losses = link budget & Received Power = max receiver sensitivity q Link budget = Transmitted Power - max receiver sensitivity q 151dB=14dBm - (-137dBm)

433/868 typical

Industry best class at 868MHz

From Peter R. Egli, INDIGOO.COM

The lower the receiver sensitivity, the longer is the range!
16

Increasing range?
q Generally, robustness and sensitivity can be increased when transmitting (much) slower
q A[Sigfox message is sent relatively slowly in a very narrow band of spectrum (hence ultranarrow-band) using Gaussian Frequency-Shift Keying modulation]. Max throughput=~100bps
q LoRa also increases time-on-air when maximum range is needed. But LoRa uses spread spectrum instead of UNB. 300bps-37.5kbps
17

LoRa vs Sigfox

Figure from SigFox

Figure from Semtech

Usual (ultra) narrow-band (UNB) vs spread spectrum (SS) arguments
UNB has lower in-band receive noise and SigFox can have more channels than LoRa But UNB needs tighter receiver synchronization and more complex signal processing at receiver (SigFox uses
advanced SDR at receiver to analyse the total band) SS can more rapidly be saturated so LoRa may have more interference issues in dense environments

From networking guys perspective, LoRa is more versatile with possibility to build ad-hoc mesh network1s8

Typical scenarios

Figure from Siradel

29

The ISM/SRD License-Free Frequency Bands
30

License-free Sub-GHz constraints
q Shared medium so long-range transmission in dense environments can create lots of interference!
q Activity time is constrained from 0.1%, 1% 10% duty-cycle depending on frequency: 3.6s, 36s/hour to 360s/hour
For SigFox, the operator typically limits the number of messages per day (140) with penalty for over usage. e.g. new messages/day = 140 – (2 * « #msg_overuse») applied during «#msg_overuse» days

Robust channel access mechanisms
q With densier LoRa networks and more heterogeneous traffic (traditional+image sensors) it is necessary to provide a more robust channel access mechanism
q Objectives are to reduce packet collisions, thus reducing delivery latency, and reduce power consumption due to unsuccessfull transmissions

Quality of Service

q Regulations stipulate that radio activity duty-cycle should be enforced at devices.
q LoRaWAN specification from LoRa Alliance is a first attempt to standardize LoRa networks but no issues on quality of service.
q Proposition of a Long-range Activity Sharing (LAS) mechanism when running under duty-cycle regulations
q Allow a device to be able to send critical data without having to wait for the next cycle

Conclusions
q Low-power, long-range (LR) transmission is a break-through technology for IoT and largescale deployment of wireless (sensor) devices
q With a large variety of applications, products & actors the low-power WAN (LPWAN) eco-system is becoming mature
q New technologies will certainly emerge but the LPWAN « philosophy » is now settled firmly: out-ofthe-box connectivity is now the standard and multi-hop scenarios based on short-range technologies is questionable.
