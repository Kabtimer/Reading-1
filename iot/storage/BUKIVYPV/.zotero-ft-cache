Abstract-The proliferation of mobile demands and increasingly multifarious services pose challenges to both the radio access networks (RANs) and the core network (CN). Unfortunately, the traditional networks can hardly meet the increasing requirements. Software-defined network (SDN) and network virtualization (NV) are considered as innovative paradigms to stress these problems. By extending SDN to wireless networks, software-defined wireless network (SDWN) consisting of both RANs and CN can be obtained. In this paper, the RANs and CN of SDWN are virtualized to virtual access points (VAPs) and network slices respectively based on NV technology. Considering the system scenario that a SDWN consists of overlapping RANs, an optimal joint YAP and network slice selection scheme is proposed. To characterize the complicated transmission performance of YAPs and network slices, the concepts of utility function and network calculus are introduced, and the joint utility of YAPs and network slices is formulated based on which the optimal YAP and network slice combination corresponding to the maximal joint utility can be selected. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.

I. INTRODUCTION
The rapid development of broadband data services poses challenges to both the radio access networks (RANs) and the core network (eN). However, traditional networks can hardly meet the increasing requirements of user services due to tightlycoupled control and date plane, inflexible network architecture, and complicated network and service management mechanisms. To stress these problems, software-defined network (SDN) technology has been proposed which is expected to dramatically simplify network control process, enable the development of sophisticated networking functions, and support user applications with guaranteed quality of service (QoS) [1]. To facilitate efficient utilization and flexible management of network resources in SDN, the network resource may be partitioned into multiple network slices of various transmission performance by applying network virtualization (NV) technology [2] .
Applying the concept of SDN to wireless networks, we obtain software-defined wireless network(SDWN) [3] which inherits the typical advantages of SDN and supports centralized management of wireless networks. As one RAN may connect to various network slices, to achieve information interaction with corresponding nodes, user equipment (UE) in SDWN may choose one access point (AP) of RANs for wireless connection and one network slice connected to the selected AP for packet transmitting over eN. In the case that a SDWN consists of overlapping RANs with

multiple APs, UEs may have to select one AP and network slice for data transmission. As the performance of APs and network slices may affect user QoS significantly, efficient joint AP and network slice selection scheme should be designed.
In recent years, the problem of AP selection has been studied for various types of wireless networks [4], [5], and the AP selection schemes have been proposed in which the transmission performance of APs is examined and the one with the optimal performance is selected. However, the transmission performance of the eN fails to be considered jointly. The access control problem in SDNs has also been considered in [6] and [7]. In [6] , a SDN-based framework is proposed for enterprise wireless local area networks (WLANs), in which a programming abstraction, i.e., light virtual access points (VAPs) is proposed to support seamlessly accessing and handovers of UEs. A scalable architecture that supports fine-grained policies for mobile devices in cellular core networks is proposed in [7]. By using commodity switches and servers, efficient access control of UEs can be achieved. However, detail access selection schemes fail to be discussed.
In this paper, we apply NV technology to both RANs and eN of a heterogeneous SDWN and propose a virtual SDWN architecture, in which, the physical access points (PAPs) in RANs are mapped into YAPs which may offer various access performance to UEs, meanwhile, the transmission resource of eN is virtualized to various network slices. By introducing the concepts of utility function and network calculus, the joint utility of the YAPs and network slices is formulated and examined, based on which, an optimal joint YAP and network slice selection scheme is proposed.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, a heterogeneous SDWN architecture is described. In Section III, the utility modeling of both YAPs and network slices is conducted and the optimal joint VAP and network slice selection scheme is presented. Simulation results are presented in Section IV. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section V.
II . ARCHITECTURE
In this section, a heterogeneous SDWN architecture is proposed in which both the RANs and the eN are virtualized based on NY. To apply NV on the RANs, the PAPs of the RANs are mapped into multiple YAPs which are the abstraction of access interfaces of RANs, such as cellular system and WiFi, etc. We assume that the mapping from the PAPs to the YAPs follows one-to-many mapping rule, more specifically, one PAP can be mapped into

multiple YAPs with the same or different wireless transmission performance.
To achieve the NV of eN, we introduce the concept of virtualized forwarding device (VFD) and virtualized network link (VNL) , which are the abstractions of wired network resources of eN, such as switches, routers and links, etc. By applying multi-dimensional network slicing, the resources of eN can be segmented into numerous network slices which are managed by a single or multiple SDWN controllers through open southbound application programming interfaces (APIs).

the effects of various parameters of YAPs/slices in a relatively fair manner, we first classify the parameters into two types and then define a unified normalization framework for both kinds of parameters.
The parameters for evaluating the QoS of YAPs/slices can be classified into two categories, i.e., reward parameters and cost parameters. The reward parameters are referred to as the parameters of which the larger quantity results in better user QoS, thus is expected to be as large as possible. The parameters such as transmission bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), etc. are typical examples of reward parameters. The cost parameters are referred to as the parameters of which the smaller quantity gives better user QoS and thus are expected to be as small as possible, for instance, access delay, power consumption of UEs, etc.
As the absolute values of the various parameters may fall in different regions and may not be comparable. In this paper, instead of examining and evaluating the absolute values of the parameters, we introduce the concept of normalized offset ratio of the parameters, which is defined as the relative value of the parameters compared to the possible maximum or minimum values. Denoting x as the parameter, the normalized offset ratio of x is defined as:

In the proposed virtual network architecture, many-to-many connections between YAPs and network slices are allowed, thus UEs accessing to the same YAP may connect to various network slices. To achieve the centralized management over YAPs and network slices, middle processing entity (MPE) is introduced, which acts like a middlebox and is responsible for status aggregation, protocol conversion, signal processing and algorithm implementation inside the YAPs. Fig. 1 shows an example of the proposed virtual SDWN architecture consisting of multiple VAPs and multiple network slices, which are marked in different colors. As shown in Fig. 1, UEs may access to different VAPs, through which, transmit information over various network slices.
III. ACCESS PERFORMANCE MODELING
In the proposed virtual architecture, each YAP may access to various network slices and each network slice may correspond to multiple YAPs at different RANs. For UEs in the overlapping area of multiple YAPs, both the YAPs and the network slices should be selected. For convenience, we use the i-jth VAP and slice pair to represent the transmission path via the ith VAP
and the jth network slice, 1 :s; i :s; M , 1 :s; j :s; N, M and
N denote the number of YAPs and network slices, respectively. As the performance of the VAP and slice pair may affect the access performance of UEs significantly, to jointly characterize the performance of VAPs and network slices, we introduce the concept of utility function, and define the joint utility of the i-jth YAP and slice pair.
A. Normalization Framework of Parameters
As both the performance of YAPs and network slices are characterized by multiple transmission parameters, to evaluate

where x min and x m ax denote, respectively, the minimum and maximum value of x required by user applications. It can be seen from (1) that x nor indicates the actual offset of x compared
to x min and x m ax . It is clear that 0 :s; x nor :s; 1, and the larger
the x nor , the better the transmission performance offered by the network.
B. Sigmoid Function Based Utility Modeling of VAPs/Slices
Based on the normalized offset ratios of parameters, a quantification model for evaluating the transmission performance of both YAPs and the network slices in SDWN can be formulated based on the sigmoid function which is originally applied in machine learning [8]. Denoting U as the utility function of the YAPs or network slices, we define
(2)
where xior denotes the normalized offset ratio of the parameter
X l, 1 :s; l :s; L, L denotes the number of parameters affecting the utility, WI E [0, 1] and x len denote the sensitivity factor and
the tolerable offset ratio of the lth parameter, respectively, and V and S are both scale constants. It can be seen from (2) that performance of VAPs and network slices can be characterized by a multi-dimensional curved surface with each normalized offset ratio of the parameters being the axis of the surface and the
parameters WI and x len determine respectively the steepness and
the inflection point of the surface, which can be chosen according to service requirements.

C. Joint Utility Function
As both the performance of RANs and that of eN will play important roles in determining the QoS of UEs, the utility function of the end-to-end performance of UEs can be formulated by jointly considering the utility of YAPs and network slices. Denoting V ij as the joint utility function of the i-jth VAP and slice pair, we define
(3)
where VP) and Vj2) denote the utility function of the ith VAP
and the jth network slice, respectively, 1 :s: i :s: M, 1 :s: j :s: N,
al and a2 are respectively the weighting factors of the RAN
and the eN, which satisfy 0 :s: aI , a2 :s: 1 and al + a2 = 1,
Oij E {O, I} denotes the binary connection variable between the ith VAP and the jth network slice, i.e., Oij = 1 indicates that
the connection between the ith VAP and the jth network slice is available, thus UEs may transmit to their corresponding network
devices via the ith YAP and the jth network slice, while Oij = 0
indicates that the connection between the ith VAP and the jth network slice is unavailable, thus UEs cannot choose to transmit via the ith YAP and the jth network slice simultaneously. The
mathematical formulations of VP) and vF) will be introduced
in the following subsections.
D. Utility Function of VAPs
The transmission performance of YAPs is jointly determined by multiple parameters. Among these parameters, user data rate and channel access delay are the most important parameters for the majority of user services. In this paper, the parameters of user data rate and channel access delay are applied to evaluate the performance of VAPs. The mathematical expressions of both user data rate and channel access delay are described in this section.
1) User Throughput: The channel transmission rate of the ith YAP can be calculated as:
(4)
where B i denotes the network bandwidth of the ith YAP, "(i denotes the SNR of the ith YAP, which can be calculated as
"(i = Pi h;j (NoBi ) , Pi denotes the transmit power of the ith
YAP, hi denotes the channel gain of the link between the ith YAP and the UE, No denotes the power spectral density (PSD) of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN).
Ci in (4) shows the achievable data rate of the link between the ith VAP and the UE when only considering link performance at physical layer, however, the actual throughput of UEs may also be affected by multiple high layer factors, such as resource allocation schemes and channel access schemes. To characterize the effects of high layer factors, we introduce the parameter transmission
efficiency, denoted as 'f/i , 0 < 'f/i :s: 1 for the ith YAP, and model
the throughput of the link between the ith VAP and the UE as:

general applies centralized network management scheme, thus no

channel competition occurs when multiple UEs accessing to the

base station (BS) at the same time, resulting in negligible channel

access delay. On the other hand, distributed resource management

and random channel accessing schemes are applied in WLAN,

resulting in relatively long channel access delay, especially when

Df a large number of UEs tend to access the channel simultaneously. Denoting as the channel access delay of of the ith VAP,

Df ;::; we assume that

0 , when UEs accessing to cellular BSs.

Df In the case that the ith VAP belongs to a PAP of WLAN,

can be calculated as [9]:

where N w denotes the total number of UEs in the coverage area of the YAP, T s and Tc denote respectively, the duration of

duration of an empty slot.
According to the discussions presented in subsections lILA and
III.B, the utility function of the ith VAP, vF ), 1 :s: i :s: M, can
be obtained by first applying normalization procedure on Ti and
Df based on (1), then replacing x/or by the normalized offset Df ratio of Ti and in (2).

E. Utility Functions of Network Slices

In this section, the transmission performance of network slices is evaluated by applying the theory of network calculus which presents a theoretical framework for analyzing the performance of queuing system, such as the eN of Internet. As network calculus is capable of transforming complex non-linear network systems into analytically tractable linear systems by using alternate algebras, i.e., the min-plus algebra and max-plus algebra, it has been applied for the modeling and analysis of various types of networks, including wireless sensor networks, switched Ethernet, systems-on-chip, etc. [10], [11].
1) A Brief Introduction of Network Calculus: In this subsection, some important concepts defined in the theory of network calculus will be introduced briefly.
Arrival Curve: Denoting I(t) as the input function of a flow, a wide-sense increasing function a(t) is defined as the arrival curve
of I(t), if and only if for all s :s: t, a(t) meets the condition:

I(t) - I(s) :s: a(t - s), t ~ O.

(7)

Introducing the convolution operation in min-plus algebra [10],
the convolution of two wide-sense increasing functions f(t) and g(t) can be defined as:

(J ® g)(t) = inf {J(t - s) + g(s)}

(8)

O::;s::; t

(7) can be re-written as:

I(t) :s: (I ® a)(t)

(9)

(5)
2) Channel Access Delay: As different channel accessing and resources management schemes might be employed for different RANs, when UEs accessing to different RANs, various channel access delay might be resulted. For instance, cellular system in

Service Curve: Given a system S and a flow through S with
input and output function being I(t) and O(t), a wide sense increasing function (3 (t) can be defined as a service curve offered by S, if and only if (3 (t) meets following conditions:

(3 (0) = 0

(10)

450

O(t) ;::: (I (9 (3 )(t)

(11)

Effective Bandwidth: Considering a system S and a flow through S with an arrival function a(t), for a fixed but arbitrary delay D, we define the effective bandwidth e(D)(a) of the flow

as the required bit rate at t to serve the flow in a work conserving manner, i.e.:

e(Dl(a) = sup ( a(t) )
t ?:o t + D

(12)

Assuming that a flow with an arrival curve a(t) passes through a server wi.th the service curve being (3 (t), denoting d(t) and b(t) as the servIce delay and the backlog of the flow, it can be proved
that d(t) and b(t) meet following constraints:

d(t):::; dmaX(a , f'3) =sup {inf {T : T~ 0; a(t):::; f'3(HT)}} (13)
0J

b(t) :s; bmax (a, (3) = sup{a(t) - (3(t)}

(14)

t?:O

where dmax (a, (3) denotes the upper bound of d(t), which is the maximum horizontal distance between a(t) and (3 (t), bmax (a, (3 ) denotes the upper bound of b(t), which is the maximum vertical distance between a(t) and (3 (t).
2) Modeling Arrival Curve of Network Slices: Without loss of generality, we assume that each network slice supports the aggregation of a number of flows with identical arrival curve model which can be characterized by traffic-specification (T-SPEC) developed by IETF [12]. Given aT-SPEC (,(p), s(m), ,(s), s(b»),
the arrival curve of flows can be modeled as:

where R j = min{Rj1 , Rj2"'" RjKJ and ej = L~~ l ejk. (18)
indicates the jth network slice offers an equivalent LR service
e curve with Rj and j being the two parameters.
4) Performance Parameters of Network Slices: Replacing a( s) and (3 (s) in (12)-(14) by aj(t) and (3j (t) formulated in (16) and (18), and after some simple mathematical manipulations, we can
obtain the upper bound of service delay and backlog, and the
effective bandwidth of the jth network slice, i.e.:

3) Modeling Service Curve of Network Slices: In this paper, we assume the servers of network slices are Latency-Rate (LR) system [13], of which the service curve can be modeled as:

(3 (t) = R(t - e) +

(17)

e where Rand are respectively the service rate and the latency
provided by the server, (x) + = max{x, o}.
As each network slice may consist of multiple servers, the service curve of the network slice can be calculated as the
convolution of the service curves of all the servers belonging to the network slices. Denoting K j as the number of servers of the jth network slice, (3jk (t) as the service curve of the kth server belonging to the jth network slice, we can obtain the service curve of the jth slice, denoted as (3j (t):

(3j(t) = (3jl (t) (9 (3j2(t ) (9 '" (9 (3jKj (t) = Rj(t - ej )+ (18)

F Optimal Access Selection Scheme

According to the performance evaluation approaches discussed in previous subsections, the end-to-end transmission performance of the SDWN can be examined. For the transmission path via the ith VAP and the jth network slice, the utility function , denoted
UP) U?) N. as Uij can be calculated by choosing Wl and fl reasonably and
replacing and obtained in (3), 1 :s; i :s; M, 1 :s; j :s;
Given Uij , a maximal utility based access selection scheme is proposed in this paper. More specifically, for the (i , j)th YAP and
slice pair which meets Oij = 1, the utility function is examined
and compared, and the optimal (i*, j *)th pair which corresponds to the maximal utility can then be selected:

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS

In this section, the performance of the proposed optimal joint utility based YAP and network slice selection scheme is examined and compared with the traditional AP selection scheme which only chooses the best AP in RANs without considering the performance of CN. The numerical simulations are conducted using MATLAB. In the simulation, we consider a heterogeneous SDWN consisting of multiple PAPs, YAPs and network slices. Table I illustrates the corresponding relations of PAPs, YAPs and network slices, where ',(' represents the connection between one YAP and one network slice is available.
Table II and Table III show the simulation parameters of RANs and CN respectively. In the simulation scenario, we assume that

service. It can be seen from the figure that effective bandwidth change slightly for small burst tolerance, then increases with the increase of burst tolerance, while the delay bound increases with the increase of burst tolerance. The reason is that the effective bandwidth and delay bound are both positively correlated with burst tolerance, as shown in (21) and (19). Comparing the performance of the effective bandwidth and delay bound of UEs with different available bandwidth of YAPs, i.e., 22Mhz and 5Mhz, we can see that both performance parameters are barely affected by the available bandwidth of PAPs, the reason is that conversational service has no strict requirement on available bandwidth.

Burst tolerance of slice2 (Kbit)

Fig. 3: Effective bandwidth, throughput vs. burst tolerance of Slice 2

Fig. 3 shows the impacts of burst tolerance of Slice 2 on effective bandwidth and throughput of UEs with streaming service. It can be seen from the figure that the effective bandwidth of UEs does not change for small burst tolerance, then increases with the increase of burst tolerance, this is because for a relatively large burst tolerance, the performance of Slice 2 is improved, thus UEs may choose to access Slice 2, resulting in an increases of effective bandwidth for larger burst tolerance. It can also be seen from the figure that the throughput of UEs does not change dramatically with the increase of burst tolerance, the

452

reason is that the performance of YAPs and network slices is relatively independent. Comparing for the effective bandwidth and throughput of UEs accessing YAPs with different bandwidth, we can see that while the effective bandwidth of network slices is similar, the throughput of VAPs is quite different for the available bandwidth of VAPs plays an important role in determining the throughput of UEs.

Fig. 4 shows the impacts of burst tolerance of Slice 2 on the backlog bound and throughput of UEs with background service. It can be seen from the figure that the throughput of UEs varies slightly with the increase of burst tolerance, while the backlog bound first decreases to certain value then does not change dramatically with the increase of burst tolerance. This is because the background service is relatively sensitive to the backlog bound, hence, UEs may access Slice 1 which offers smaller backlog bound compared to Slice 2.

Fig. 5: End-to-end QoS utility analysis

Fig. 5 shows the end-to-end QoS utility of proposed scheme compared to traditional scheme which chooses the AP with the best wireless performance without considering the performance of the CN. It can be seen from the figure that the end-to-end QoS utility of the proposed scheme offers better performance compared to the traditional scheme. Furthermore, the utility of

the proposed algorithm increases slightly alongside the increase of burst tolerance of Slice 2, this is because the effective bandwidth increases with the increase of burst tolerance, hence resulting a larger end-to-end utility. On the contrary, the utility of the traditional algorithm fails to increase with the performance enhancement of the wired network, which is highly undesired.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we study the access selection scheme of heterogeneous SDWNs and propose a joint utility optimization based YAP and network slice selection scheme. By applying NV, the RANs and CN of the SDWN are virtualized to YAPs and network
slices, respectively. By introducing the concepts of utility function and network calculus, the transmission performance of YAPs and network slices are formulated, and the jointly utility of different pairs of YAPs and network slices is modeled and examined, based on which, the optimal YAP and network slice pair corresponding to the maximum joint utility can be selected. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.
