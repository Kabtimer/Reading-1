n Cons of 802.11p/Ad hoc
- Needs gateway for provision of central services (e.g., RSU) - No pre-deployed hardware, and hardware is still expensive

n Security in WAVE
n Nature of WAVE messages mandates trust between nodes n Ex: Green wave for emergency vehicles
n Security is built into WAVE (IEEE 1609.2) n WAVE can transparently sign, verify, encrypt/decrypt
messages when sending and receiving n Ex: WSA à Secure WSA n Authorization of messages needed n By role: CA, CRL-Signer, RSU, Public Safety OBU (PSOBU), OBU n By application class (PSID) and/or instance (PSC) n By application priority n By location n By time

n Certificates
n Encryption is useless without authentication n Alice ⬄ Eve ⬄ Bob n Eve can pretend to be Alice, replace K+A with own key K+E
n Solution: use Trusted Third Party (TTP) and certificates n TTP signs (Name, Key) tuple, vouches for validity and authorization: “Alice has Public Key K+A, may participate as OBU until 2019” n not: “whoever sends this packet is Alice” n not: “whoever sends this packet has Public Key K+A”
n Send K+A together with certificate vouching for tuple
