Preface
Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) have recently received a great deal of attention as a promising cost-effective solution to provide coverage and broadband wireless connectivity for mobile users to get access to different IP applications and services.
The factor that has helped WMNs become attractive is the wide application prospects from the wireless community, home and enterprise networking. Moreover, wireless mesh technologies are becoming more and more popular in the context of their integration with heterogeneous next generation networks for purposes of backhaul support, traffic offloading, load balancing, fixed-mobile convergence, etc.
However, making these WMNs operationally efficient is a challenging task. In recent years, there has been a lot of work on research issues. Nevertheless, there still exist some open research challenges related to link scheduling, channel assignment, routing and other network planning issues in multi-radio multi-channel WMNs. The main objective of this book is to highlight some recent efforts in developing novel efficient design strategies and efficient algorithms to significantly improve performance and functionality of WMNs. The results presented in this book are expected to help in taking design decisions when deploying WMNs.
Ten contributed chapters written by a group of well-known experts in wireless mesh networking are arranged in two sections.
Section 1 focuses on link scheduling schemes to select a subset of links for simultaneous transitions under interference constraints in an efficient and fair manner to guarantee a certain level of network connectivity. Besides, it describes channel assignment strategies to improve the network throughput in multi-radio multi-channel WMNs by means of an efficient channel utilization and minimization of the interference. Chapter 1 of this section describes a framework for fair link scheduling based on the application of genetic algorithms taking into account both the QoS requirements of data flows between mesh clients and underlying network characteristics affecting the overall system performance. Chapter 2 deals with the stability-based topology control mechanism using the underlying link scheduling policy of WMNs to optimize the ability of links to carry the information transported by end-to-end data flows. Chapter 3 introduces a topologycontrolled interference-aware channel assignment algorithm based on power control which intelligently assigns the available non-overlapping frequency channels to the

X Preface
wireless mesh routers with the objective of minimizing interference to improve network throughput. Chapter 4 discusses the optimal number of radio interfaces for wireless mesh routers depending on the topology of the mesh network (grid or random), the number of network nodes and the number of data flows in the network. Chapter 5 takes an in-depth look into recent channel assignment schemes exploiting partially overlapping channels in the context of multiple radio WMNs.
Section 2 addresses some important network planning issues related to efficient routing protocols in dynamic large-scale mesh environment, achievable capacity limit of a single wireless link between two multi-interface mesh nodes, the correctness of the mesh security architecture, fault-tolerant mesh network topology planning. Chapter 6 of the section presents an autonomous traffic balancing routing protocol based on a combination of back-pressure and geographic routing schemes. The proposed mechanism is inspired by the electrostatic potential theory and able to react adaptively to dynamic traffic environment in large-scale WMNs with a low routing overhead. Chapter 7 presents an indepth analysis of the impact of multipath and MIMO fading channels on achievable theoretical capacity limits of single links connecting mesh nodes and the impact of number of interfaces and channels per each mesh node on the end-to-end capacity limits of wireless broadband mesh networks. The capacity limits provide useful inputs towards an optimal design of cross-layer protocols. Chapter 8 examines correctness of the mesh security architecture using a protocol composition logic to prove security of the IEEE 802.11s protocol suite. Chapter 9 deals with a fault-tolerance method for guaranteeing the availability of radio coverage and connectivity of wireless mesh networks in dynamic propagation environment. It also proposes an automatic mesh router planning algorithm, which finds a minimum number of wireless mesh routers and their positions to restore the fault-tolerant network mesh topology. Chapter 10 describes a channel reservation scheme in combination with an on-demand routing protocol to establish high throughput paths in multi-radio multi-channel environments and reduce the intra/inter flow interference for the traffic going towards the mesh gateways.
Thus, this book covers a variety of issues related to link scheduling, channel assignment, routing and network planning in WMNs and provides an in-depth look into recent advances in these topics. The book can be useful for researchers, PhD students, engineers, and practitioners that are interested in wireless mesh networking.

1. Introduction
WMN (Wireless Mesh Network) is usually built on fixed stations and interconnected via wireless links to form a multi-hop network. Typical and inexpensive deployment of WMNs use some MSSs (Mesh Subscriber Station) and one MBS (Mesh Base Station), where their multi-hop feature can be utilized to increase their range of accessibility in rural areas effectively. Moreover, since they are dynamically self-organized and self-configuring, these networks turn to be more reliable. TDMA-WMN (Time Division Multiple Access-WMN) is a special WMN which has some special features: TDM (Time Division Multiplexing) is adopted between MSSs and the MBS to access the air interface; frames are defined and divided into some equal duration subframes to provide better timing and synchronization to MSSs. As these subframes (called transmission opportunities) are taken by MSSs to transmit packets on unidirectional links, it’s more preferable to schedule each link rather than each node connection. Four sources of interference are defined in TDMA-WMNs: - Transmitter-Transmitter: each node can’t receive data flows from more than one source. - Receiver-Receiver: each node can’t send data flows to more than one destination. - Transmitter-Receiver: each node can’t receive and transmit simultaneously. - Transmitter-Receiver-Transmitter: two sources can’t transmit at the same time while the
transmitter and the receiver share a neighbor which can hear both transmissions. For example, in Figure 1 where the two conflicting links (e1 and e7) are shown with bold lines, nodes cannot transmit simultaneously as they share the same neighbor (Node 2) which can here both transmissions. The first three sources of interference are known as first hop conflict (primary conflicts) and the fourth one is knows as second hop conflict (secondary conflicts). Second hop conflict is disregarded in most of the presented works [1], [2].

Figure 1. A TDMA-WMN with its conflicting links

A major challenge in WMNs is to provide QoS support and fair rate allocation among data flows. Almost all of the routing and scheduling algorithms presented in the literature have one common weak point: when the MBS collects requests larger than the frame length from all the MSSs, these algorithms shrink link durations to fit in the frames. Scaling down the link durations may cause some drawbacks in guaranteeing the QoS requirements of voice and video traffic. Two schemes can be exploited to overcome this problem: 1) A call admission control mechanism can be deployed to avoid link duration shrinkage; 2) A new scheduling method may be proposed to schedule the packets received from the underlying network. In this chapter we focus on the second solution with respect to the first solution.
Scheduling in WMNs is divided in two categories: centralized and distributed scheduling. In centralized scheduling, there exists one MBS and the other stations (MSSs) relay packets of other stations to/from end points (in this chapter we call these end points as MTs, while MSSs assume to be fixed). The main purpose of this chapter is related to centralized scheduling and admission control.
On the other hand, rapid growth of wireless networks has commenced challenging issues in co-deployment of various technologies including WiFi, WiMAX. While WiFi networks are very popular for providing data services to Internet users in LAN environments, WiMAX technology has been adopted for MAN networks to provide urban accessibility to hot spots or end users. These two technologies seem to be competitors; however, they can interwork to gain metro-networks performance, cost effectiveness and coverage area. This configuration can be used in TDMA-WMNs, however when the same frequency band is employed with different network elements (e.g., the U-NII frequency at 5GHz may be shared among IEEE 802.16d and IEEE 802.11a or IEEE 802.11n), more complex strategies are required for scheduling and packet translation from one technology to another.
In this chapter, with respect to the interoperability of WiFi and TDMA-WMNs networks, we develop a scheduling and admission control mechanism among data flows such that the QoS requirements of delay sensitive traffic types can be provisioned and elastic traffic types get a fair duration of bandwidth.

Application of Genetic Algorithms in Scheduling of TDMA-WMNs 5
To provide QoS support for delay sensitive traffic over WiFi, IEEE 802.11e introduces two types of channel access methods: EDCA (Enhanced Distributed Channel Access) and HCCA (Hybrid Coordination Channel Access). Since the HCCA function deployed in the MTs is essentially designed to meet the negotiated QoS requirements of admitted flows, we apply this function to the WiFi network [3], [4].
The chapter is organized as follows: in sections 2, some research activities in scheduling mechanisms in WMNs and IEEE 802.11 are summarized. In section 3, we introduce an overview of IEEE 802.16 and IEEE 802.11(e) standards. QoS comparison between IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.16 mesh modes are described in this section. Fourth section is devoted to describe the system model. In this section we introduce the basic assumptions of the system and formally describe the system. In fifth section, the genetic algorithm is briefly described and its application to our problem is discussed. The proposed method is evaluated using simulation results in section 6. Finally, conclusions are drawn in seventh section.
2. Related works
Centralized scheduling mechanism in WMNs has been investigated in [1], [2], [5]-[10], [3233]. Most of the research activities in this area are not suitable for TDMA mesh networks (e.g., IEEE 802.16d). They consider only primary conflicts in which the connections share a neighbor, while TDMA-WMN is faced with secondary conflicts where the transmitter and the receiver share a neighbor, which can hear both transmissions.
The main algorithm in IEEE 802.16d finds a link ranking during a breath-first traversal of the routing tree. This algorithm has no idea for spatial reuse in the network. Spatial reuse in these networks has been investigated in [5], [7]-[10]. Ref. [9] uses Transmission-Tree Scheduling (TTS) algorithm that is based on graph coloring. This algorithm don’t consider the protocol overhead of TDMA scheduling. While [10] uses the load-balancing algorithm to increase spatial reuse, [8] considers Bellman-Ford method for both spatial reuse and minimum TDMA delay. These schemes don’t take into account the underlying network behavior which can affect scheduling of traffic flows of other MSSs. On the other hand, these algorithms shrink the link duration when the frame is short for scheduling the links.
Application of intelligent scheduling methods in wireless mesh networks has been inspired by the fact that finding a schedule in TDMA scheduling is NP-complete [11]. Ref. [12] uses fuzzy hopfield neural network technique to solve the TDMA broadcast scheduling problem in wireless sensor networks. Artificial neural network with reinforcement learning has been introduced in [13] to schedule downlink traffic of wireless networks. A genetic algorithm approach is used in [2] to find the schedule related to each link in a WMN. Here again, their scheduling method merely considers the traffic flown on the links; however, how these links empty their queues has not been elaborated.
None of the above research activities, consider neither the underling network behavior nor the types of traffic streams flown on the links. Our system model is different from the

6 Wireless Mesh Networks – Efficient Link Scheduling, Channel Assignment and Network Planning Strategies
previous works in two aspects. First, we take into account the underlying network traffic related to each MSS. Second, the algorithm proposed in this chapter is such that shrinking the link duration doesn’t affect the minimum QoS requirements of real-time traffic types.
3. IEEE 802.16 and IEEE 802.11e: An overview 3.1. Overview of IEEE 802.11e
The multiple access mechanism in 802.11e is arisen in super-frames which start with beacon frames having the same duration as beacon intervals. The super-frame comprises an optional CFP (Contention Free Period) followed by a CP (Contention Period) divided into equal duration SIs as shown in Figure 2. At each SI (Service Interval), each QSTA (QoS Station) should transmit its own traffic streams with respect to its QoS constraints. This mechanism is called HCCA function which defines a centrally-controlled polling-based medium access scheme for IEEE 802.11e WLANs. Each SI is divided into a CAP (Controlled Access Phase) period and an optional EDCA period in which the traffic streams having less stringent QoS constraints contend for access to the medium. Usually best effort traffic streams such as HTTP use this period which offers no QoS guarantee. The CAP period is further divided into a number of TXOPs (Transmission Opportunity). Each TXOP is granted by QAP (QoS Access Point) to each QSTA and each QSTA is responsible for sharing this period among its traffic streams.
Figure 2. HCF super-frame structure
3.2. Overview of IEEE 802.16 mesh mode
IEEE 802.16 MAC PDUs (Protocol Data Unit) (Figure 3) begin with a fixed-length generic MAC header (6 bytes). The MAC header field contains a 2 bytes CID (Connection Identifier) field which carries 8 bits Link ID used for addressing nodes in the local neighborhood. The header is followed by the Mesh sub-header (2 bytes) which includes Xmt Node Id. Mesh BS grants Node Ids to candidate nodes when authorized to the network. After the variable length payload there exists a 4 bytes CRC. The medium in IEEE 802.16 mesh mode is divided into equal duration frames (Figure 4), consisting of two sub-frames:  Data sub-frame,  Control sub-frame.

Application of Genetic Algorithms in Scheduling of TDMA-WMNs 7
The control sub-frame is divided into MSH-CTRL-LEN transmission opportunities indicated in the ND (Network Descriptor). Each transmission opportunity comprises 7 OFDM symbols, so the length of the control sub-frame is fixed and equal to 7×MSH-CTRL-LEN OFDM symbols.
Figure 3. MAC PDU format
Figure 4. Frame structure for the mesh mode
Nodes can transmit based on the granted bandwidth and a transmission schedule which is worked out using a common distributed algorithm. The data sub-frame is used for this purpose which is divided into transmission opportunities comprising 256 mini-slots based on the standard. However, there may be fewer than 256 mini-slots depending on the frame size and the size of the control sub-frame. Frame duration which is indicated in ND is determined by MBS to avoid losing synchronization with the connecting nodes. MSHCSCH-DATA-FRACTION indicated in ND specifies the fraction of data sub-frame which can be used for centralized scheduling. The remaining part of the data sub-frame is used for decentralized scheduling.
3.3. QoS Comparison between WiFi and WiMAX mesh mode
Providing QoS in IEEE 802.11e comes with a new coordination function called HCF. The HCF controlled channel access is for the parameterized QoS, which provides the QoS based on the contract between the AP and the corresponding QSTA(s). First, a traffic stream is established between the AP and an QSTA. A set of traffic characteristics and QoS requirement parameters are negotiated between the AP and QSTA and the traffic stream should be admitted by the AP. The QoS control field in the MAC frame format is a 16 bits field which facilitates the description of QoS requirements of application flows. Its TID (4 bits) identifies the TC (0-7) or the TS (8-15) to which the corresponding MSDU in the FB field belongs. The last eight bits are used usually by QAP to receive the queue size of QSTAs. After admission, the AP specifies the TXOP duration for the QSTA based on the traffic characteristics. So, the QoS is provided based on connections established between AP and QSTA(s).
Unlike WiFi, the QoS in the mesh mode of IEEE 802.16 is provided in a packet by packet basis. Each transmitted packet contains the mesh CID. Figure 5 shows the structure of mesh CID used in unicast messages. In order to enable differentiated handling of packets, the queuing and forwarding mechanisms deployed at individual nodes may make use of the values for the Type, Reliability, Priority/Class, and Drop Precedence fields. The Type field is used to distinguish between different categories of messages. This field may be used to

8 Wireless Mesh Networks – Efficient Link Scheduling, Channel Assignment and Network Planning Strategies
prioritize the transmission of management messages transmitted in the data sub-frame (e.g., messages for uncoordinated distributed scheduling). The Reliability field is employed to specify unacknowledged transmitted packets (when ARQ is enabled). This allows the packet to be retransmitted for up to four times. The Priority/Class field allows the classification of the messages into eight priority classes. This can be used by the queuing and forwarding mechanisms at each node to differentiate the packet treatment for different classes. The Drop Precedence field indicates the likelihood of a packet being dropped during congestion.
Figure 5. Mesh CID format
4. System model
SSHC stationary end nodes (Figure 6) are able to communicate from one side with MTs and from the other side with MSSs or MBS via their PHY layers in both sides. In the following subsections we develop a genetic based system for scheduling the packets waiting in the SSHCs queues.
Figure 6. Topology of the scenario
4.1. Basic assumptions
In this chapter we consider a WMN with one MBS and some MSSs (Figure 6). We consider access traffic in the mesh network, so the routes of the traffic form a binary tree rooted at the MBS. MSSs relay numerous traffic types (data, voice or video) between their MTs and other

Application of Genetic Algorithms in Scheduling of TDMA-WMNs 9
MSSs or the MBS. The MBS, MSSs, and MTs share the same frequency band. The routing tree that is made by the MBS is a binary tree [14], and we assume that it’s known in advanced.
For better support of QoS, we consider MBS and MSSs use TDMA-based scheduling in their MAC layer; however, because of IEEE 802.11 deployment in most mobile devices (laptops and cell phones), MTs use contention-based medium access method. In a given TDMA frame (of the length for example 20ms), some MSSs are sending frames upward or downward the network, while the others are collecting (distributing) frames from (to) MTs. Since the tree rooted at the MBS is a binary one, each MSS has maximum of six logical links to its neighbor MSSs; three for sending and another three for receiving packets (Figure 1). As wireless transceivers are usually half duplex [8], they can’t be used for reception and transmission at the same time. So there are six queues in each MSS, three of these are to store the outbound packets and three others are for inbound packets to queue for reception. However, in our model receiving queues are ignored as they are considered in sending nodes; hence at most three queues are considered for scheduling. It’s worthy to note that we schedule only one queue at each leaf node and two queues at the MBS. Moreover we schedule only the links that have non-empty queues. Each queue is filled by MTs (shown in Figure 6) or the receiving links at that node. For example in Figure 1, the queue of e2 can be filled by the queue of e4.
Let, M be the set of all the stations (including MSSs and the MBS) in the system, indexed by m=1,2,…,M. We consider M>1; i.e., there is at least one MSS. In most of the mesh networks, the frame length is fixed and may not be changed; otherwise the whole system should be restarted [8]; hence the frame length is fixed at L milliseconds. Each transmission in the frame is along with some overheads, so the number of transmissions for each link should be limited to one per frame to minimize transmission overhead.
Let be the set of all the links in the system. We take a subset I of (I⊂ ) , in which the links have non empty queues. Each i∈I has one queue per traffic type which are assumed to have unlimited sizes for the sake of simplicity.
Each queue has some restricted QoS traffic specifications; this means that each queue should be scheduled appropriately and get emptied in a desired time. Since the frame length is fixed and all of the links in the system should be scheduled at each frame (because of their restricted QoS requirements), there is a limited interval for each queue to get scheduled. Nevertheless, some of the nodes may not find enough transmission opportunity to evacuate all of their queues, causing the system not to be able to fulfill QoS constraints of delay sensitive traffic types. So, a scheduling method is strongly necessary to satisfy QoS requirements of voice and video traffic. On the other hand, bandwidth allocation to more stringent QoS traffic types may cause starvation for elastic traffic. As such, we define a threshold (k), to assure the elastic traffic types to be scheduled at each k frames.
Let km,i,j be the length of the jth queue (filled by MTs or other MSSs), associated with ith outgoing link, related to mth MSS. So, [km,i,j] is an M × I × J matrix. Each queue should be

10 Wireless Mesh Networks – Efficient Link Scheduling, Channel Assignment and Network Planning Strategies
scheduled to transmit its packets over the appropriate link based on the QoS requirements of its content.
[km,i,j] is available at the MBS through some control messages. Assuming that a 64Kbps voice stream should be serviced in each frame, it generates a 160 bytes packet which is to be transmitted in each 20ms frame. In case of a video traffic stream, its packets should be scheduled every two frames [15].
Some of the main parameters of each traffic type in the system are as follows [16]:
 Delay Bound (D): Maximum amount of time allowed (including queuing delay) to transmit a frame across the wireless interface.
 Mean Data Rate (ρ): Average bit rate at the MAC layer required for the packet transmissions.
 Nominal Packet Size (L): Average packet size.  Maximum Packet Size (M): Maximum packet size.  Minimum Service Interval (mSI): Minimum interval between the start of successive
service period.  Maximum Service Interval (MSI): Maximum interval between the start of successive
service period.  Next, we describe the formal formulation of our system.

4.2. Problem formulation

Each queue is scheduled once in each frame. We assume that spatial reuse is deployed in the routing algorithm, so:

∑ ∈ ∑∈ ∑∈

, , ≥ , ∀ = , = 1,2,3, …

(1)

Where Tr is the data transferred from the queue j in the current frame, associated with ith outgoing link, related to mth MSS. L is the length of the frame and F is a parameter that specifies the scheduling duration which is a sub-multiple of L. The above inequality means that due to spatial reuse mechanism applied to the system, the number of transmissions may exceed the frame length.

At the end of each frame, the remaining number of packets in all of the queues should be minimized:

min ∑ ∈ ∑ ∈ ∑ ∈ . . − ∑ ∈ ∑ ∈ ∑ ∈

,, , ∀ =

(2)

In the above minimization problem, K specifies the number of residual packets waiting in the queue for scheduling. We assume three different queues (e.g., CBR, VBR, and elastic traffic) for each link with higher priorities indexed by lower numbers. The following constraints are applied on queue depletions:

, , > 0, ∀ =

∀=

(6)

Inequality (3) means that the first queue should be scheduled in every k frame. Two other inequalities state that their related queues may be scheduled in every k frame optionally. Inequality (6) demonstrates that the priority of the first queue is higher than the second one and the second queue is more prior than the third one.

The minimization problem (2) with its constraints (1), (3), (4), (5), and (6) are such that they can’t be solved by simple mathematics; since the problem shown to be NP-complete [11]. Heuristic solutions might work in certain cases, but they fail to adapt to different network scenarios [2].

The above optimization problem can be bounded and reformulated such that speed convergence can be obtained as described in the following sentences. As the first queue is reserved for CBR traffic streams, the second queue is reserved for VBR traffic streams, and third one is reserved for elastic (ABR) traffic type, then the first queue should be serviced in each frame, and the second one should be services in every two frames [15]. After that, the remaining bandwidth (if any) is considered for the third queue. Available bandwidth should be fairly shared among the queues. For this purpose, we take advantage of a threshold (k) to force the scheduler to take a minimum percent of the available bandwidth for elastic data types. This causes a fair scheduling method for elastic traffic types and will be presented in the simulation results. Now we have the following optimization problem with its conditions. It can be seen from the minimization problem (7) that the number of queues per each link and the number of links per each node is bounded on 3 (as discussed earlier); so the search space is limited and convergence to the termination conditions will be faster than the previous problem (2).

4.3. Admission control

The CBR queue should be emptied at the end of its schedule or the backlogged packets are to be dropped. So, the new connection should be rejected if the following equation is not satisfied:

,, − ., =0

(13)

While the VBR queue get filled in different intervals, we put a threshold on the top of its queue. If the number of the packets available in the queue is greater than this threshold, then any new call will be rejected. So:

(14)

The elastic traffic queue can be filled every time a packet is generated, but may cause undesirable delay, so, we impose a threshold (τ2) on the third queue as well. However τ2 should be greater than τ1, since elastic data types have lighter QoS constraints than VBR
data types.

5. Application of genetic algorithm in scheduling of SSHCs queues
In the following subsections we first present an overview of genetic algorithm, and then we develop a GA-based scheduling mechanism for the problem.

5.1. Genetic algorithm: An overview
The genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural evolution. This heuristic is routinely used to generate useful solutions to optimization problems. Genetic algorithms belong to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms, which generate solutions to optimization problems using techniques inspired by natural evolution, such as inheritance, mutation, selection, and crossover [17], [18].
In a genetic algorithm, a population of strings (called chromosomes or the genotype of the genome), which encode candidate solutions (called individuals, creatures, or phenotypes) to an optimization problem, evolves toward better solutions. An initial population is created from a random selection of solutions (which are analogous to chromosomes). A value for fitness is assigned to each solution (chromosome) depending on how close it actually is to solve the problem and arrive to the answer of the problem. Those chromosomes with higher fitness values are more likely to reproduce offspring. The offspring is a product of the father and mother, whose composition consists of a combination of genes from them (this process is known as crossing over). This generational process is repeated until a termination condition has been reached. Common terminating conditions are:
 A solution is found that satisfies minimum criteria.  Fixed number of generations reached.

Application of Genetic Algorithms in Scheduling of TDMA-WMNs 13

 The highest ranking solution's fitness is reaching or has reached a plateau such that successive iterations no longer produce better results.
 Manual inspection  Combinations of the above.
At each stage, crossover and mutation genetic operators may be applied to the new strings. Crossover is a genetic operator that combines two chromosomes (parents) to produce a new chromosome (offspring). The idea behind crossover is that the new chromosome may be better than both of the parents if it takes the best characteristics from each of the parents.
As an example, suppose there are two chromosomes 1 and 2 which are represented as a binary string, the most used way of encoding a chromosome, as the following:

Chromosome 1 1101100100110110 Chromosome 2 1101111000011110
Crossover selects genes from parent chromosomes and creates a new offspring. The simplest way how to do this is to choose randomly some crossover point and everything before this point copy from the first parent and everything after the crossover point copy from the second parent. | is the crossover point. The following shows this process:

Chromosome 1 Chromosome 2 Offspring 1 Offspring 2

11011 | 00100110110 11011 | 11000011110 11011 | 11000011110 11011 | 00100110110

After performing the crossover, mutation is used to maintain genetic diversity from one generation of population chromosomes to the next. It introduces some local modifications of the individuals in the current population on order to explore new possible solutions. For binary encoding of chromosome, we can switch a few randomly chosen bits from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1. For our example, the mutation process is shown as the following:

Original offspring 1 Original offspring 1 Mutated offspring 1 Mutated offspring 2

1101111000011110 1101100100110110 1100111000011110 1101101100110110

The pseudo-code of a basic GA is summarized as follows:

1. Choose the initial population of individuals 2. Evaluate the fitness of each individual in that population 3. Repeat on this generation until termination: (time limit, sufficient fitness achieved, etc.) i. Select the best-fit individuals for reproduction. ii. Breed new individuals through crossover and mutation operations to give birth to
offspring. iii. Evaluate the individual fitness for new individuals. iv. Replace least-fit population with new individuals.

5.2. A GA-based approach for the scheduling problem
In the previous section, the optimization problem which is needed to create a population was formally defined. This population is created by the MBS based on the fact that the MBS gathers queues’ statistics of SSHCs through some control messages. Each chromosome of the population is such that every queue gets its service once per frame, so the scheduling overhead could be minimized. Each queue is scheduled as close to the beginning of the frame as possible, so that its transmission does not overlap with transmissions of its conflicting links. The scheduling period is set to two frames, since VBR traffic streams get their services every two frames.

Figure 7. A typical frame (chromosome) with its SSecs (genes) associated with Figure 1

Each gene is defined as a scheduling section (SSec). A scheduling section is composed of one or more time slots in which a queue and its non-conflicting queues are scheduled to transmit in parallel. The first scheduling section is started at the beginning of the frame. All the scheduling sections are consecutive and non-overlapping.
The crossover operator is 0.5-uniform crossover [19]. Each SSec of one chromosome can be exchanged with equal-size SSec of another chromosome, with a constant probability of 0.5. Each scheduling section (gene) is subject to random mutation with a small independent probability. We use permutation encoding; hence each gene replaces with a duplicate of other equal-size genes (e.g., replace the SSec3 with the SSec5 in Figure 7).
Finally, we should use some QoS metrics of the network (that we want to optimize) to define the fitness function. It can be seen from the Eq. (7) that we are interested in depletion of all the queues in the scheduling period. On the other hand, when more queues get emptied, higher performance will be reached; hence, Eq. (7) can be explicated as Eq. (16).

6. Simulation results
We developed a TDMA-WMN system based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) air interface that works in 5GHz frequency band using NS-2 simulator [20]. Basic OFDM parameters are listed in Table 1. OFDM symbol duration is about 14µs. TDMA frame duration (L) is set to 20ms. While TDMA-WMN uses BPSK-1/2 modulation technique, the underlying network (WLAN) uses 16QAM-1/2 modulation technique. Different modulation techniques have been used; because interference between MTs of different SSHCs should be avoided (Figure 6).

We define three types of traffic in the system: CBR, VBR, and ABR traffic streams. CBR traffic (e.g., voice over IP without silent suppression (G.711)), has constant packet size with constant packet interval. VBR traffic (e.g., H.263 video), has variable packet size with variable packet interval feature. At last, elastic traffic (e.g., FTP), can adjust its transmission rate gradually.
Voice and video traffic stream specifications are as follows:
a. G.711 voice (CBR traffic) which generates packets of 160 bytes with mean service interval of 20ms (64 Kb/s of average sending rate).
b. H.263 video (VBR traffic) which has been obtained from “Jurassic Park I” trace file, available in [21].
Traffic specifications of these two types of traffic are summarized in Table 2. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that elastic flows are generated using CBR traffic sources with packet size of 1000 bytes.

16 Wireless Mesh Networks – Efficient Link Scheduling, Channel Assignment and Network Planning Strategies

In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheduler and the admission control procedure, the topology of Figure 6 is considered as the scenario. All of the end nodes (SSHCs) are active, while the intermediate nodes (MSSs) pass only the traffic of the end nodes. SSHCs are configured to work in both WLAN and TDMA-WMN modes; while, MSSs work in TDMA-WMN mode. k is fixed at 4, since elastic traffic queues are scheduled every four frames. From one hand, this value is not too small that causes some drawbacks on delay sensitive traffic types and on the other hand it’s not too large that leads to unfairness.
At first, we assume one VBR MT and one ABR MT and a number of CBR MTs which are gradually increased (Figure 8). It can be seen when there is no admission control mechanism, as the number of MTs exceeds 10, packets of the newly added MTs are dropped. The proposed admission control mechanism for this traffic type works well, since none of the packets has been dropped when it is applied.

In the next simulation, the number of CBR MTs and ABR MTs are fixed to one and the number of VBR MTs (Figure 9) is gradually increased. Since the packet size and the arrival time are variable in case of the packets of these traffic types, the number of admitted VBR MTs is less than the number of admitted CBR MTs. In this figure the packet loss is due to the threshold (τ1) applied to the queue length. Here again the proposed admission control mechanism works well for this type of traffic.
For the last simulation, we removed all of the thresholds to see how many packets will be backlogged in the queues after scheduling the queues. For this purpose we monotonically increase the number of CBR, VBR, and ABR MTs in each SSHC. It can be seen from Figure 10 that the CBR queue is at its normal size, since almost all of its packets are serviced in appropriate time. However, after the second frame, all of the packets of elastic data type are queued, since there is no chance for them to be scheduled. Moreover, since all of the VBR

packets do not receive the opportunity to be scheduled, the VBR queue length increases monotonically.

7. Conclusion
In this chapter we considered an important aspect of TDMA-WMNs: Traffic flow requirements on scheduling the links. Moreover, we considered the underlying network which can affect the overall system performance despite previous research. We assumed three types of traffic with different QoS requirements and formulated a model describing the scheduling

optimization problem which is to be solved to minimize queues in the system. We develop a genetic algorithm method to find the optimal schedule for each relaying node. Furthermore to be able to fulfill QoS requirements of established connections, we developed an admission control mechanism. Finally, the performance of the proposed GA algorithm along with the admission control procedure was evaluated by simulating a typical network scenario. Simulation results showed effectiveness of our admission control and scheduling mechanisms. In our next work, we introduce some new mechanisms including MIMO technique to the above-mentioned system and investigate its performance. Meanwhile, application of genetic algorithms in distributed scheduling of WMNs is investigated.

1. Introduction
Topology control1 in wireless mesh networks is an important problem due to the effects it has on the different layers of the protocol stack [1]. For example, the network connectivity, energy consumption, total physical-link throughput, spatial reuse, and total end-to-end throughput as a function of the network topology have been investigated in [2-6] respectively. In this chapter, we look at the problem of topology control for adapting the stability region of the link-scheduling policy of the network. Therefore, we start by defining the problem of link scheduling and the stability region.
The goal when designing link-scheduling policies is to achieve maximum throughput while making the policies amenable for implementation [7, 8]. Link scheduling refers to the selection of a subset of links for simultaneous transmission that have the following characteristic: When the links are activated simultaneously, the interference between them is low enough to allow successful reception for every activated link. A link-scheduling policy specifies the mechanism that determines, for every time slot, a subset of links that fits this characteristic. For example, consider the network and the link (i, j) shown in Figure 1. Let this network operate under the frame structure shown in Figure 2. Therefore, in the network, time is divided into frames; each frame is divided into a control subframe and a data subframe, and each subframe is further divided into a series of time slots. Whenever link (i, j) is activated by the link-scheduling policy during a data-time slot, the link transmits a data packet. In order for the packet to be received successfully, none of the links that interfere with (i, j) can be active while (i, j) is active. Otherwise, the packet transmitted by node i is not received successfully by node j . This is known as a packet collision at

node j , i.e., the packet transmitted over (i, j) collides with the packet transmitted over the interfering link. The set of links that interfere with (i, j) is denoted by  (i,j) in Figure 1. Therefore, when (i, j) is active, none of the links in  (i,j) can be active. Given that every link has a set of interfering links, only subsets of the set of all links in the network can be active at a given time. The task of the link scheduling policy is to select one of these subsets for every data-time slot. This selection is done by exchanging control information during the control-time slots.
Figure 1. Interfering Links
Figure 2. Frame Structure
Besides considering the interfering link sets of every link, the link-scheduling policy needs to consider the queue length of every link. In a wireless mesh network, when data packets are being transported over the flow's path, the links that form the path need to store the packets temporarily from the moment the node receives the packet until the moment the node forwards the packet to the next node in the path. Therefore, each link maintains queues of data packets for every flow that it belongs to. This is shown in Figure 3, which includes the queues of both link (i, j) and link ( j,i) . Each link has two queues. These are the input and output queues, which are denoted by Qi(i,j) and Qo(i,j) respectively for link (i, j) . When node i receives a data packet that needs to be forwarded to node j , it stores the packet in Qi(i,j) first. Then, it exchanges control packets with neighboring nodes in order to determine the data subframe and data-time slot when the data packet can be transmitted to node j without collisions. This is done according to the link-scheduling policy of the network. Once the transmission schedule of the data packet has been determined, the packet is moved to Qo(i,j) where it waits for the data-time slot scheduled for its transmission. Finally, node i forwards the packet to node j at the scheduled data-time slot. At this point, the packet leaves Qo(i,j) . When node j receives the data packet, it checks whether it is the

Stability-Based Topology Control in Wireless Mesh Networks 23
packet's destination. If it is, the packet is no longer stored in any queue and leaves the network2. If it is not, it starts the link-scheduling process again in order to forward the packet to the next node in the data flow's path.
Figure 3. Data-packet transmissions over links (i, j) and ( j,i)
When designing a link-scheduling policy, the goal is to support the largest set of data-packet rates for all the flows established in the network, and this should be done while guaranteeing the following conditions:  There are no packet collisions  The queues do not grow indefinitely  A given level of fairness is guaranteed for all the flows Packet collisions need to be avoided in order to guarantee the completeness of the information being delivered to the user. Given the limited amount of memory that nodes have, the queue lengths need to be guaranteed not to grow indefinitely. Otherwise, the nodes will drop data packets when they have run out of memory to store the packets while the transmission schedules are being determined. The fairness among data flows guarantees that each flow is assigned some part of the total capacity of the network to transport information3. The mathematical formulation of this problem is based on Markovian systems [9]. In order to do this formulation, the following definitions for each node's queues need to be considered first. In Equations 1 and 2, 1j is the set of 1-hop neighbors of node j . These are the nodes that have links with node j . Therefore, Qij is the total number of packets stored in node j ’s 1-hop neighbors that need to be forwarded to node j and that are waiting to be scheduled, and Qoj is the maximum number of scheduled packets waiting to be forwarded to node j among all of j 's 1-hop neighbors4. The time indexes n and mn represent the nth
2Actually, node j sends the data packet to its application layer so that the packet's content can be finally delivered to the user. 3It should be noted that there is not an absolute definition for fairness. For example, the network operator may be interested in assigning the same maximum data-packet rates to all flows or different maximum rates to different flows depending on the demands of the users. 4The actual length of Qoj has a more involved definition. However, for the sake of clarity, we do not consider the exact definition until Section 4.2.1.

Consider the following measure of the queue lengths of all links in the network, where  is the set of all nodes in the network, and the indexes i and o indicate whether input or output queues are being considered.

 Vsi,o(n)  (Qij,o(n))2

(3)

j

Intuitively, Vsi,o(n) can be interpreted as a total volume occupied by all of the input or output queues5, depending on whether the index is i or o , and that is updated at every control-time slot in which there is at least one control-packet transmission. Vsi,o(n) increases and decreases randomly in time. It increases due to the data packets that the flows input
into the network, and it decreases when data packets reach their destination and leave the
network. This is shown graphically in Figure 4, which includes a network of 7 nodes. The
volume of the network, shown in circles, increases and decreases according to the queue
lengths in the network.

Figure 4. Network stability
Based on the concept of Vsi,o(n) , the stability of a network can be defined as follows. A network is stable if Vsi,o(n) decreases to zero with some probability greater than zero at some finite future time n  m , i.e., there is a probability that the volume of the network decreases to zero within some finite time independently of the current volume. It can be shown that this condition is met if the expectation that Vsi,o(n) decreases is greater than zero [9]. Therefore, a network is stable if Equation 4 holds6.
5In the theory of Markovian processes [9], Vsi,o (n) is known as a Lyapunov function. 6 E[ X | Y ] denotes the expected value of X given Y .

Stability-Based Topology Control in Wireless Mesh Networks 25

E[Vsi,o(n  1)  Vsi,o(n)|Vsi,o(n)] < 0

(4)

A network becomes unstable when the rate at which data flows input packets into the network increases to a point in which the link-scheduling policy is not able decrease queue lengths fast enough to guarantee the condition given by Equation 4. Therefore, the task of the link-scheduling policy is to maintain the network stable under the constraints that there should not be data-packet collisions and that data-flows are fairly serviced.

The performance of the link-scheduling policy in performing this task is measured in terms of the set of data-packet rates for which it guarantees that the network is stable. The largest set of data-packet rates supported by the link-scheduling policy is known as the stability region. In order to compare different link-scheduling policies, these are usually compared against the optimal stability region, which is the largest region that any policy can achieve7. This comparison is done using the concept of efficiency ratio, which is defined as the fraction of the optimal stability region in which a suboptimal link-scheduling policy guarantees the stability of the network. Therefore, an optimal link-scheduling policy has an efficiency ratio of unity. When the link-scheduling policy has an optimal efficiency ratio, the network is able to support the largest set of data-packet rates, and so it achieves maximum throughput.

The stability region of most link-scheduling policies depends on the interference sets of the links in the network. This can be observed, for example, in the following case that considers two links of a network. If the two links interfere with each other, only one of them can be active at a time. However, if they do not interfere with each other, they can be active simultaneously. Therefore, when they do not interfere, the links are able to support higher datapacket rates for the flows that they belong to, and this increases the size of the stability region. Given that the interference sets are determined from the network topology, i.e., from the relative distance between nodes and their transmission powers, the stability region can be modified by controlling the network topology. Therefore, for a given network with a given link-scheduling policy and a given set of end-to-end data flows, the stability region can be adapted by means of topology control in order to increase the data-packet rates supported by the links for the flows that they belong to. An example of this adaptation is shown in Figure 5. This example considers two flows. There are an initial stability region and a final stability region. The coordinates of the operating point indicate the data-packet rates of the two flows. Therefore, as the flows increase their data-packet rates, the operating point moves further away from the origin. Given that the operating point has not crossed the boundary of the initial stability region, the network is stable. After controlling the network topology, the stability region is modified such that the distance from the boundary of the region to the operating point is increased. Therefore, the final stability region allows the operating point to be moved further away from the origin without crossing the boundary. In this way, the flows are able to operate at higher data-packet rates without destabilizing the network.

7The optimal stability region and the link-scheduling policy that achieves it were characterized in [10].

Figure 5. An example of stability-region adaptation
In the following, the operation and performance of the different link-scheduling policies is discussed. Special attention is given to reservation-based scheduling (RBDS) policies [8,11]. Then, based on the stability region of RBDS policies, the topology-control mechanisms are discussed.
2. Link-scheduling policies8
The challenge in link scheduling is that the policies are highly complex. The scheduling problem in general is nondeterministic polynomial time (NP) hard [12]. Therefore, the research literature has focused on policies of lower complexity that are more amenable to implementation [7]. Most distributed scheduling policies that achieve provable efficiency ratios calculate, at the onset of every frame, a subset of links that is allowed to transmit data in the immediately following frame only. In this chapter, we refer to these policies as non-RBDS policies, i.e., they do not reserve any future frame but only the following one. On the other hand, RBDS policies [8, 11] select links to transmit data in any future frames by means of frame reservations. Since this framework considers reservations of any future frames, non-RBDS policies correspond to a special case within the RBDS framework, i.e., the case that links are allowed to reserve the next frame only. It should be noticed that non-RBDS policies require the input queue only (i.e., Qi(i,j) ). They do not need the output queue (i.e., Qo(i,j) ) because data packets do not need to wait for future data subframes. In non-RBDS policies, once a data packet is scheduled at the onset of the data subframe, the packet is transmitted immediately.
2.1. Non-RBDS policies
The concept of optimal stability region and a centralized scheduling policy with efficiency ratio of unity were introduced in [10]. The centralized scheduling policy attempts to solve a complex global optimization problem so that the entire network is stable for the largest possible set of input data-packet rates. Under the 1-hop interference model9, the problem is
8The material presented in this section is based on the material presented in [8, 11]. 9In the 1-hop interference model, only the links that the 1-hop neighbors of a node belong to interfere with the links that the node belongs to.

Stability-Based Topology Control in Wireless Mesh Networks 27
shown to correspond to a maximum weighted matching (MWM), where the weights of the links are determined from the length of their queues. The solution to MWM has complexity O(N3) [13, 14], where N is the number of nodes. Under the k -hop interference model, the problem has been proven to be NP-Hard [12]. Therefore, the optimal scheduling policy is not convenient for implementation due to its high complexity. As a consequence, less complex scheduling policies that achieve only a fraction of the optimal stability region for general network topologies have been developed [12, 15-28].
The different suboptimal scheduling policies proposed in the literature can be classified according to the techniques they use to calculate the next schedule. These techniques usually depend on the interference model assumed for the network and the links' weights at the onset of every frame. Also, the suboptimal scheduling policies can be further classified according to their centralized or distributed mechanism (Unless otherwise specified, the scheduling policies reviewed in this section consider 1-hop traffic only, i.e., the data flows' paths have one link only.).
2.1.1. Centralized policies
In [15], a centralized scheduling approach known as pick-and-compare [17] that achieves the optimal efficiency ratio is defined. The pick-and-compare scheduling policy selects the optimal schedule at every frame with some probability greater than zero. First, the scheduling algorithm randomly picks a new schedule such that the links can satisfy the interference model constraints. Then, the newly picked schedule is compared with the current schedule. If the picked schedule reduces the total weight of the network (i.e., queue lengths) more than the current schedule, then the picked schedule is selected as the next schedule; otherwise the current schedule is used again. The pick-and-compare policy requires the calculation and comparison of the updated total weight for every frame. Therefore, the complexity of this technique grows linearly with N , which makes it difficult to implement in networks with a high number of nodes or in networks where nodes have low processing capabilities.
Greedy maximal scheduling (GMS) is a suboptimal, centralized scheduling policy. In GMS, the links of the network are ordered according to their weights, where the link with maximum weight is placed at the top of this globally ordered list. A valid schedule is found by selecting links from the list from top to bottom that do not interfere with each other. The complexity of GMS is O(L log(N)) , where L is the number of links [29]. GMS has efficiency ratio of 1/2 under the 1-hop interference model [7], and under the k -hop interference model, GMS has efficiency ratio of 1, 1/6, and 1/49 for tree, geometric, and general network graphs respectively [12, 27].
2.1.2. Distributed policies
A distributed version of the pick-and-compare scheduling policy was proposed in [19]. In this policy, a node is selected with some probability less than one to initiate the calculation of a schedule for the links in its neighborhood. The new schedule is selected for the next

28 Wireless Mesh Networks – Efficient Link Scheduling, Channel Assignment and Network Planning Strategies

frame if the new schedule reduces the neighborhood's weight by more than the current schedule. The algorithm has constant complexity, so it does not depend on the number of nodes of the network. It does depend, however, on the diameter of the neighborhood. The efficiency ratio increases as the diameter of the neighborhood increases. The algorithm assumes the 1-hop interference model, so it can only be directly used on networks with physical layers such as frequency-hopping code-division-multiple-access (FH-CDMA) that allow that assumption to be made.

Greedy scheduling (GS) policies [29] have been developed that achieve the same efficiency ratio of GMS [17, 25, 28]. In the GS policies, nodes calculate locally the next schedule based on the links that have the maximum local weights.

In [17, 20-23], a maximal scheduling (MS) approach is described. In this approach, maximum weight is not required to schedule a link. A link is eligible for the next schedule as long as it has enough packets in the queue to transmit during the entire duration of a frame. The efficiency ratio of MS scheduling policies is 1/  , where  is the maximum number of non-interfering links in the interference set of any link in the network. MS policies have also been adapted to multi-hop flow scenarios10 in which a set of flows with their respective rates and routes are given [16, 20-23].

Lastly, distributed scheduling policies of complexity O(1) have been developed in [18, 24,

30]. These are known as constant time (CT) scheduling policies [17]. The CT approach differs from the MS approach in that when a link does not interfere with the links in a schedule, it is selected with probability less than one. Therefore, in CT scheduling policies, frames can be wasted with some probability greater than zero. In [30], CT policies are proposed for the 1hop and 2-hop interference models11. The efficiency ratios of these policies were improved in

[18, 24]. In [25], the improved efficiency ratios are 1  2

for the 1-hop

and 2-hop interference models respectively, where nˆ is the maximum number of 1-hop neighboring links for any link of the network.

2.2. Reservation-based distributed scheduling
In an RBDS wireless network, the nodes negotiate with their neighbors the reservation of future data-time slots for their links. This negotiation is based on a three-way handshake that consists of a request, a grant, and a grant confirmation. Requests, grants, and grant confirmations are transmitted in scheduling packets. The nodes access the control-time slots for transmitting scheduling packets using an election algorithm. Therefore, in an RBDS wireless network, the nodes access the wireless channel using two different algorithms: the

10A multi-hop flow has a path that is at least 2 links long. 11In the 2-hop interference model, only the links that the 1-hop or 2-hop neighbors of a node belong to interfere with the links that the node belongs to. The 2-hop neighbors of a node are the nodes that have a shortest path to the node of length 2 links.

Stability-Based Topology Control in Wireless Mesh Networks 29
election algorithm and the RBDS algorithm, whose roles are to avoid collisions and wasted time slots in the control and data subframes respectively.
In this chapter we assume that the election algorithm is given, and we focus on the RBDS algorithm only. For example, in the IEEE 802.16 standard [31], the election algorithm is completely specified while the link-scheduling algorithm is not. The standard only specifies the control messages that can be used for the implementation of RBDS policies. We adopt the election algorithm of IEEE 802.16 wireless mesh networks with coordinated distributed scheduling. Also, it is assumed that the RBDS wireless network follows the 2-hop interference model, which is the model considered in the IEEE 802.16 standard [31].
In the IEEE-802.16 election algorithm, the nodes in every 2-hop neighborhood take turns by competing between them to access the control-time slots and transmit scheduling packets. Let the 2-hop neighborhood of node i , i.e., node i , its 1-hop neighbors, and its 2-hop neighbors, be denoted by i 2 . We model the operation of this election algorithm as follows12.
 In order to avoid scheduling-packet collisions, no more than one node is selected in every i 2 at any control-time slot.
 The nodes in i 2 , where i can be any node in  , are selected in cycles. We refer to these cycles as scheduling cycles.
 Within a scheduling cycle, the nodes in i 2 are selected once and only once each. The order in which they are selected is uniformly distributed among all the possible orders of selection.
 The order that nodes in i 2 are selected is independent across scheduling cycles.
When nodes i and j exchange scheduling messages to perform the three-way handshake, they schedule data packets on link (i, j) and multicast the negotiated schedule to all links in  (i,j) . The handshake consists of the following steps13.
1. Node i sends a request to node j for a certain number of data-time slots along with a set of data-time slot numbers that are available for reservation at node i .
2. Node j sends a grant to node i for the requested number of data-time slots according to its set of data-time slots available for reservation and those of node i .
3. Node i confirms the successful reception of the grant by echoing the grant in its next scheduling-packet transmission.
The reservation of the data-time slots takes place at steps 2 and 3. When node j transmits its scheduling packet, j 's 1-hop neighbors receive the grant and mark the granted data-time slots as unavailable. When node i confirms the grant, i 's 1-hop neighbors receive the grant and mark the granted data-time slots as unavailable too. Therefore, at the end of step 3, all
12The operation of the election algorithm for IEEE 802.16 mesh networks with coordinated distributed scheduling is described in detail in [32, 33].
13It is assumed that in this handshake node j grants node i 's request and that the data-packet-slot reservation is successful at both i and j .

30 Wireless Mesh Networks – Efficient Link Scheduling, Channel Assignment and Network Planning Strategies
links in  (i,j) have made the granted data-time slots unavailable (i.e., the grant has been multicast to all links in  (i,j) ).
The requests and grants transmitted by the nodes are defined as follows.
Definition 1. Request rm(i,j)  ( fs , fx , z) , where ( fs , fx , z)  N3 , is the request transmitted by node i at control-time slot m that requests for link (i, j) the data-time slots of z consecutive data-subframes starting at frame fs or any other frame after fs . Request rm(i,j) expires at the onset of frame fx .
Definition 2. Grant g(mi,j)  ( fs , fe ) , where ( fs , fe )  N2 , is the grant transmitted by node j at control-time slot m that assigns to link (i, j) the data-time slots of the series of frames that starts and ends with frames fs and fe respectively. Grant g(mi,j) expires at the end of frame fe .
Definition 3. The length of grant g(mi,j) , denoted by |g(mi,j) |, is the number of data-subframes assigned in the grant. Therefore,

|gm(i,j) | fe  fs  1.

In order to implement RBDS policies, each node maintains two tables per link that the node

belongs to. These are the unavailable-data-time-slots table and the requested-data-time-slots

table. The tables are updated with the grants and requests exchanged with the node's 1-hop

neighbors. An unavailable-data-time-slots table contains the set of unexpired grants that

interfere with the link that the table belongs to. This set is denoted by u(i,j)(m) for link (i, j)

and is given by Equation 5, where (g(mx,y) ) current frame number (i.e., the frame that

In RBDS policies, two grants overlap with each other if the frame ranges given by their respective fs and fe frame numbers have one or more frame numbers in common.

2.2.1. RBDS Markovian system model
In order for RBDS policies to be mathematically characterized under the framework of network stability proposed in [10], it is necessary to show how networks that use RBDS policies can be modeled as Markovian systems [9].

Stability-Based Topology Control in Wireless Mesh Networks 31

In an RBDS network, each link has an input-queue and an output-queue as described in Section 3. The length of an input-queue (i.e., Qi(i,j)(m) ) is defined as the number of data packets in the queue. The length of an output-queue (i.e., Qo(i,j)(m) ) corresponds to the number of data-subframes in the following frame range: from the current frame to the last

frame scheduled for the packets in the output-queue. Therefore, the length of output-queues

does not depend on the number of scheduled packets waiting to be transmitted but on the

A node transmits scheduling packets by accessing control-time slots according to the
election algorithm. The next control-time slot that node i is going to access is determined by this algorithm. This control-time slot is denoted by Mi(m) , i.e., at control-time slot m , the
future control-time slot that node i transmits a scheduling packet is control-time slot Mi(m) .

Based on the previous definitions, RBDS wireless network  = ( ,) , where  and  are
the sets of nodes and links respectively, can be represented as a Markovian system whose state  is given by the lengths of the input and output queues of all the links and the
scheduling control-time slots of all the nodes. That is,

    Qi(i,j)(m),Qo(i,j)(m), Mi (m) : (i, j)  ,i   .

(8)

Within this framework for RBDS networks, the stability analysis of different RBDS policies can be performed. In the following, a greedy-maximal RBDS policy is considered.

2.2.2. The greedy-maximal RBDS policy and its stability region
The GM-RBDS policy is as follows. When any node i in  transmits a scheduling packet,
 It grants the longest request among all the unexpired requests made by its incoming links, and sets the grant's fs component at the frame following the interfering grant that expires the latest.
 For every of its outgoing links, it requests as many consecutive data-subframes as unscheduled data packets cover entirely, sets every request's fs component at the frame following the interfering grant that expires the latest, and sets every request's fx component at the frame scheduled for its next scheduling-packet transmission.
When any node i in  receives a scheduling packet, it checks whether there is a grant in the packet and whether the grant is directed to one of its outgoing links. If that is the case, it confirms the grant only if the grant does not overlap with any of the grants in the link's unavailable-data-time-slots table.

The GM-RBDS policy is greedy maximal in the sense that the requests that are granted are the longest requests and each request corresponds to the maximum integer number of datasubframes that are covered by a link's unscheduled data packets (i.e., each request

where

Qi(i, j)

is the number of unscheduled data packets to be

transmitted on link (i, j) , and mds is the number of data-time slots per data-subframe).

The size of the stability region of the GM-RBDS policy depends on the ability of the links to perform the three-way handshakes successfully. If the probability that a link finishes successfully a three-way handshake is low, the link's queue will decrease at a lower rate. Therefore, the link's ability to forward data packets within some time range is going to be lower (i.e., the highest packet rate supported by the link is lowered), and this reduces the size of the stability region. In [8], it was shown that the probability that a three-way handshake of link (i, j) is successful depends on the following aspects of the 2-hop neighborhoods of nodes i and j .
 The set of active nodes that i can listen to but j cannot, where an active node is a node
that either forwards data-packets or is the destination node for at least one flow. This set is given by ai \aj , where ai is the set of active 1-hop neighbors of node i , and \ refers to the relative complement, i.e., ai \aj  {k  ai : k  aj } .  The degree d(i,j) of link (i, j) , which is defined as the number flows that traverse link
(i, j) .
 The direct 1-hop neighborhood of a node which is defined as the set of 1-hop neighbors that send data packets to the node. Therefore, the direct 1-hop neighbors of a node always precede the node in at least one flow's path. Node j 's direct 1-hop neighborhood is denoted by dj .
Based on the probability of successful three-way handshakes, sufficient conditions that guarantee queue stability under the GM-RBDS policy are given as follows15.
Theorem 1. Let  = ( ,) be a wireless mesh network that operates under GM-RBDS, shortest-path routing, and the 2-hop interference model, where  and  are the sets of nodes and links of the network respectively. Let fj be the maximum packet rate that node j can support for each of the flows for which it is an intermediate or destination node.  is
stable if the packet rate fj supported by every node j in  satisfies Equation 9.

15The proof of Theorem 1 is given in [34].

Stability-Based Topology Control in Wireless Mesh Networks 33

Therefore, in order to guarantee stability under shortest-path routing and GM-RBDS, the data-packet rate of a flow must be less than the following rate: the minimum packet rate among all the packet rates that nodes along the flow's path can assign to the flow. This is shown in Equation 10, where  is the set of data flows in the network, fn is the nth flow in  , pn is the path followed by fn , n is the data-packet rate of flow fn , and mj ax is the upper-bound for node j 's rate fj according to Equation 9 (i.e.,
 mj ax  (5 idj d(i,j) |ai \aj |)1 ).

n < min{mj ax : j  pn}  fn  

(10)

Remark. Notice that the sufficient condition for stability given by Equation 9 is of the same form of the condition for the non-RBDS greedy policies analyzed in [23] (Equation 4 in [23]). That is, the total packet-arrival rate of a set of interfering links needs to be lower than some constant in order to guarantee stability, and the constant depends on some characteristic of the network topology (i.e., ai \aj for the GM-RBDS policy, and  for the greedy policies in [23]). Other policies have the same behavior as well. For example, the stability properties of GMS [27] and the bipartite simulation (BP-SIM) [24] policies depend on the local-pooling factor16 and the maximum node degree17 of the network respectively, and these are determined by the network topology.

3. Stability-based topology control18
In this section, we look at the problem of topology control for adapting the stability region of the backbone of the wireless mesh network to a given set of flows such that the total throughput is improved. This topology-control framework was originally studied in [34-36]. Specifically, we ask the question of what are the nodes' transmission powers (TP) that adapt the stability region to the flows in the network when a set of source-destination pairs, the routing algorithm, and the link-scheduling policy are given. Notice that by adapting the TPs of the nodes (i.e., wireless mesh routers and gateways), the topology of the network is being controlled due to the creation and elimination of links. Also, notice that the flows correspond to the traffic established across the wireless mesh routers and gateways of the network.
By adapting the stability region of the network, the queue lengths across the network are decreased in average for a given set of flows' data-packet rates. In this way, the flows among the source-destination pairs are able to maintain higher levels of end-to-end throughput and lower levels of end-to-end delay while guaranteeing queue stability. Therefore, the problem considered in this chapter is of particular interest for applications that establish non-bursty sessions between source-destination pairs such as audio/video calls.
16 The local-pooling factor is a topological property of the network that indicates how different the effectiveness of the different maximal link schedules is from each other [27]. When the different maximal link schedules are similarly effective, GMS policies are able to support packet rates that are closer to the boundaries of the optimal stability region. 17 The node degree is defined as the number of links that the node belongs to. 18 The material presented in this section is based on the material presented in [34, 36].

34 Wireless Mesh Networks – Efficient Link Scheduling, Channel Assignment and Network Planning Strategies
In order to adapt the stability region, we propose an algorithm that is executed by the flows established between the source-destination pairs. The idea behind the algorithm is to adapt a lower-bound region of the stability region (i.e., a region covered by the stability region) by modifying the TPs. The lower-bound region is a widely accepted theoretical performance metric used for comparing different link-scheduling policies [23]19. In the algorithm, once the flows' paths are determined by the routing algorithm, the flows calculate the maximum data-packet rate they can support within the lower-bound region; then, each flow tries to stretch the lower-bound region by modifying the TP of nodes surrounding it. The effect that the stretch of the lower-bound region has on the stability region is another stretch on this region. Therefore, the result is a stability region adapted to the flows that allows them to support higher data-packet rates while guaranteeing the stability of the network. A graphical example of this adaptation was shown in Figure 5.
We consider IEEE 802.16 wireless mesh networks that operate under shortest-path routing and the GM-RBDS policy. However, our results can be readily extended to other networks, routing algorithms, and link-scheduling policies.
3.1. Stability-region expansion algorithms
The main idea presented in this chapter (i.e., adapting the stability region of a given linkscheduling policy by means of TP control) is based on the results obtained in [37, 38, 39]. In [37], the network is partitioned based on the notion of local pooling, and each partition is assigned to a channel of the network. In this way, the GMS policy is guaranteed to achieve the optimal stability region in each channel. In [38, 39], network topologies are identified for which distributed link-scheduling policies achieve the optimal stability region. However, these network topologies are not suitable for real scenarios [27] because of their sufficient conditions that guarantee the optimal stability region. These conditions include [38] 1-hop interference, 1hop traffic, and a topology that is a graph that belongs to one of the following perfect-graph classes: chordal graphs, chordal bipartite graphs, cographs, and a subgroup of cocomparability graphs. In real scenarios, these conditions limit the suitability of wireless mesh networks. For example, only a few physical-layer technologies such as code-division-multipleaccess (CDMA) can be approximated with the 1-hop interference model, and the traffic in wireless mesh networks is multihop by definition. Also, making the topology fall within the previous graph families imposes constraints on the locations and TPs of the nodes and the available routes. The multihop traffic case was considered in [38], and it was shown that only a subset of the previous graph families guarantee the optimal stability region in the multihoptraffic scenario. These were identified as forest of stars, where every connected component of the network graph is a star graph. Also, the results in [37, 38] are valid only for GMS policies under 1-hop traffic or backpressure routing-scheduling policies under multihop traffic20. In
19The reason for this is that the exact formulation of the stability region is not actually available. The stability region is usually characterized with the lower-bound region because its exact characterization is not feasible due to its complexity. See [8, 10, 11, 16, 18, 19, 23-25, 29, 30] for the literature on the problem of characterizing the stability region of link-scheduling policies. 20It should be noted that the objective in [37, 38] was mainly to identify the topologies that enable the optimality of the GMS policy, and not to design topology-control algorithms.

Stability-Based Topology Control in Wireless Mesh Networks 35
[40], a random-power-selection algorithm for random-access scheduling policies was proposed. It is shown that it achieves maximal throughput in the following sense: the throughput achieved by any fixed power selection is at most equal to the throughput achieved by the random-power-selection algorithm.
Our approach is built upon the idea of [37, 38] that under certain topologies a link scheduling policy performs better. We modify realistically the network topology using TP control to adapt the policy's stability region to the flows. The algorithm receives any set of end-to-end paths, node locations, and scheduling policy, and adapts the policy's stability region to the paths. Such an approach is beneficial because it improves the end-to-end throughput and delay without the restrictions previously discussed. In this chapter, we consider the case of shortest-path routing, GM-RBDS scheduling, and randomly chosen source-destination pairs of nodes in IEEE 802.16 mesh networks.
Other heuristic algorithms have been proposed in the literature that improve the performance of the link-scheduling policy in terms of throughput by means of TP control. These algorithms include the ones reported in [41-43] whose basic idea is to increase the total throughput in the network by means of spatial reuse. The spatial reuse is increased by reducing the TP of the nodes. The algorithms differ between them in the way they are adapted to request-to-send (RTS)/clear-to-send (CTS) based protocols. In [44, 45], it is shown that better throughput improvements can be achieved not only by decreasing the TP to increase the spatial reuse but also by considering the hidden and exposed nodes. The algorithms proposed in [44] perform TP control with the objective of avoiding hidden nodes. In this way, the links in the network are able to sustain higher data-packet rates. In [46], a TP control algorithm for RTS/CTS-based protocols is proposed that decreases the area occupied by links during their transmissions, which is defined as the area in which other nodes must remain silent during the time the link is active. Then, it is shown that with this scheme, routing algorithms that favor short hops achieve higher levels of throughput. The goal of our algorithm is similar to the goal of the previous algorithms [41-46], i.e., to increase the data-packet rates that a given link-scheduling policy can support by means of TP control. However, our approach differs in that it is directly based on a quantitative metric which is the stability region. It is not based on qualitative observations of the operation of the link-scheduling policy such as the hidden and exposed nodes in RTS/CTS-based policies. Therefore, it can be readily adapted to any link-scheduling policy whose stability region has been characterized such as the ones discussed in Section 4.
A different type of TP control algorithms, which are based on optimization techniques, are discussed in [47, 48]. In [47], the problem of integrated link scheduling and TP control for throughput optimization is shown to be nondeterministic polynomial time (NP) complete. Therefore, a heuristic algorithm is developed. The goal of the algorithm is to minimize the schedule length necessary to satisfy all the link loads determined by a given routing algorithm. By minimizing the schedule length, the total throughput of the network is increased because more scheduling cycles can be performed per time unit. In [48], the problem of jointly optimizing the flow routes, link schedules, TP, modulation and coding schemes is addressed. This is a more general problem than the one considered in [47] given that it does

36 Wireless Mesh Networks – Efficient Link Scheduling, Channel Assignment and Network Planning Strategies
not only include the calculation of TPs and link schedules but also includes the routing and physical layers (i.e., flow routes, modulation, and coding schemes). In our algorithm, we are only concerned in the TP control problem when the flows and link-scheduling policy are given. That is, for a given set of flows, we determine TPs that improve the performance of the link-scheduling policy in terms of throughput and end-to-end delay.

3.2. The HSRA-topology-control algorithm

The goal of our TP control algorithm is to expand the lower-bound region given by Equation
10. By expanding this region, the flow rates n can take higher values while guaranteeing stability, and therefore, the maximum total throughput the network can support for the given
flows is increased. Let the maximum total throughput be denoted by T and defined in terms of the lower-bound region for the flows' data-packet rates given by Equation 10 as follows.

Given that the flows are determined by the shortest-path routing algorithm, the following parameters in Equation 12 are fixed: {pn   } , {dj : j   } , and {d(i,j) : (i, j)  } . Therefore, in order to increase T , the only parameters that can be modified are the active 1-hop neighborhoods (i.e., {aj : j   } ). They can be modified by means of TP control such that T is maximized. This optimization problem, which we call stability region adaptation for
throughput maximization (SRA-TM), is given as follows.

Definition 4. Given a set of flows  calculated by the shortest-path routing algorithm, the
SRA-TM problem consists of the maximization of T by means of TP control such that none of the nodes exceed the maximum TP and none of the paths are broken. That is,

where ri is the transmission radius of node i , rmax is the maximum transmission radius, and ||i, j|| is the Euclidean distance between nodes i and j .

Remark. In the SRA-TM problem, the flow paths are given and left unmodified. Higher values for T could be achieved if the flow paths were modified by including them as decision variables. For example, a routing scheme can uniformly distribute the traffic loads
across the links of the network so that links with high levels of congestion are avoided. This
problem corresponds to a joint optimization of the topology and flow paths based on the stability region. This problem can be further studied due to its potential benefits on T . However, this chapter deals only with the stability-region-based topology control as a first
step towards the problem of stability-region-based joint topology and routing control.

Remark. If the data traffic in the network changes dynamically, the flow paths may change as well. In this scenario, the SRA-TM problem needs to be solved for every flow-path change. Therefore, the speed of convergence of algorithms that solve the SRA-TM problem is an important metric for such a scenario. The algorithms should be able to keep up with the rate of change of the flow paths. On the other hand, if the data-traffic levels of a set of flows change but the flow paths do not change, the SRA-TM problem does not need to be solved again. The reason is that the solution of the SRA-TM problem is the topology that allows those flows to support the maximum level of data traffic while guaranteeing stability. This means that the data-traffic levels in the flows may vary as long as they do not exceed such maximum levels (i.e., min{mj ax : j  pn}  fn   ), and this can be guaranteed by means of call-admission-control algorithms.

In order to solve the SRA-TM problem, the following TP algorithm is proposed. It is called heuristic stability region adaptation (HSRA)21.

The following definitions are necessary for the operation of the HSRA algorithm.

Definition 7. The MinPower setup is the set of minimum TPs whose transmission ranges guarantee that none of the links of the flows in  is broken.

The operation of the algorithm is as follows. First, the nodes' TPs (i.e., {ri : i   } ) are set according to the MinPower setup (line 2 of the HSRA Algorithm). By reducing the TPs (Definition 7), the spatial reuse in the network is increased, and as a consequence, the total throughput is increased as well22. Then, the maximum throughput that intermediate and

21The SRA-TM problem is formulated as a mixed integer program with non-linear constraints in [34]. This formulation is used in Section 6 for calculating the optimal solution of the simulated instances of the SRA-TM problem. 22This spatial-reuse-based TP control is the basis of the algorithms proposed [39-43, 46].

38 Wireless Mesh Networks – Efficient Link Scheduling, Channel Assignment and Network Planning Strategies
destination nodes can support for the flows they belong to is calculated (line 3 of the HSRA Algorithm). This is done using Equation 9, which defines the nodes' maximum throughput. Based on these maximums, the total throughput the network can support is calculated (line 4 of the HSRA Algorithm). Once the total throughput under the MinPower setup is known, flows are selected randomly one-by-one for a number of M times (line 5 of the HSRA Algorithm). Every time a flow is selected, the maximum throughput the flow can support is increased if this causes that the total throughput be increased as well. Otherwise, the flow is left unmodified. The throughput of the selected flow is increased as follows. Let the selected flow be denoted by fn (line 6 of the HSRA Algorithm). The bottleneck node of fn is found first by tracking the node of the flow with the lowest maximum throughput (Equation 10). Let this node be denoted by j (line 7 of the HSRA Algorithm). The maximum rate of j (i.e., fj ) is increased by increasing the TP of one of j 's 2-hop neighbors (lines 8 to 15 of the HSRA Algorithm). However, this TP increase is confirmed only if the total throughput (i.e., T ) is increased as well (lines 16 to 20 of the HSRA Algorithm). Otherwise, the TP of j 's 2-hop neighbor is left unmodified (line 22 of the HSRA Algorithm). The total throughput may be decreased given that the TP increase of j 's 2-hop neighbor may

Stability-Based Topology Control in Wireless Mesh Networks 39
decrease the maximum rate of other bottleneck nodes in the network, and this maximumrate decrease may be higher than the increase on j 's maximum rate.
The 2-hop neighbor of node j whose TP is increased is selected so that the factor |ai \aj | on the denominator of the upper-bound for fj is decreased (Equation 9). Qualitatively, this TP increase can be explained as follows. Node j (i.e., the bottleneck node) has a set of 1-hop neighbors that are sending data packets to it (i.e., dj ). Let i be one of these nodes, and consider the link (i, j) and the input and output queues Qi(i,j) and Qo(i,j) of node i as shown in Figure 3. In order for i to transmit packets to j , a reservation of future data-time slots is required. When nodes i and j finish this reservation successfully, data packets in node i 's input-queue (i.e., Qi(i,j) ) are moved to node i 's output-queue (i.e., Qo(i,j) ), and these packets are later pulled from Qo(i,j) for their transmission. Therefore, for the queues Qi(i,j) and Qo(i,j) to have their lengths decreased, the reservation performed by nodes i and j needs to be successful, i.e., the three-way handshake for scheduling data-packet transmissions on link (i, j) needs to be successful. The probability that the handshake is successful and that the queues decrease their length depends on the grants received by node i and not received by node j . In the following, we refer to these grants as hidden-grants. If i requests future data-time slots to j and a hidden grant is received by i before j transmits its grant to i , j 's grant may not be confirmed by i . This is because the hidden grant may interfere with j 's grant. On the other hand, if j is able to listen to the hidden grant, j is able to generate its grant such that it does not interfere with the hidden grant, and i will be able to confirm j 's grant23. Therefore, in order to increase the probability of handshake success and queue decrease, the TP of the node that transmits the hidden grant (i.e., the node hidden from j ) can be increased such that node j is able to listen to the hidden node's transmissions.
Node j may have more than 1 hidden nodes in every incoming link from the nodes in its direct 1-hop neighborhood. The HSRA algorithm chooses only one of those hidden nodes for increasing its TP. The node that is chosen is the node that is hidden from the highest number of nodes (i.e., node j and all the other intermediate or destination nodes unable to listen to the hidden node). This is performed in lines 8 to 12 of the HSRA Algorithm. In this way, the maximum rate is increased for all those nodes so that, if one or more of those nodes are bottleneck nodes, higher improvements on the total throughput can be achieved.
The role that the objective function of the SRA-TM problem (Equation 13) plays in the HSRA Algorithm is the quantification of the throughput improvement by the TP increase on hidden nodes. By increasing the TP of a node hidden from a bottleneck node, the factor ai \aj in the denominator of Equation 13 is decreased for the bottleneck node, and as a consequence the bottleneck node's maximum rate is increased. However, the TP increase on the hidden node may also cause an increase on the ai \aj factor of other bottleneck nodes. Therefore, the objective function allows the algorithm to trade off between decreasing the number of hidden nodes by increasing TP and maintaining spatial reuse by not increasing
23The problem of node j not being able to listen to hidden grants is the hidden-node problem version for reservationbased distributed scheduling policies. This problem is studied in detail in [8, 11].

TP. In the algorithm, this tradeoff is achieved by testing the improvement on the total throughput (lines 14 to 23 of the HSRA Algorithm).

4. Simulation results
The performance evaluation of the HSRA algorithm was performed by means of simulation using the simulator proposed in [49]. The simulated network is an IEEE 802.16 mesh network with distributed scheduling under the configuration shown in Table 1. The number of nodes was specified as a simulation parameter. The nodes were uniformly distributed in a square area such that the node density was always kept at 15 nodes per unit area. The maximum transmission range of the nodes was set at 0.3 (i.e., rmax = 0.3 ). The connectivity of the network under bidirectional links and with the nodes' transmission ranges set at rmax was confirmed before executing the shortest-path routing algorithm. The number of flows was specified as a simulation parameter. The source and destination nodes of every flow were uniformly distributed among all the nodes in the network. The shortest-path routing algorithm calculated the flow paths under the MaxPower setup which is the power assignment when all the nodes' transmission ranges are set at the maximum (i.e., rmax ). Once the paths were calculated, the transmission ranges of the nodes were found using the HSRA algorithm. Also, the optimal transmission ranges (i.e., the solution to the SRA-TM problem (Equation 13)), which we call OptPower, were found in [34] using the formulation of the SRA-TM problem as a mixed integer program with non-linear constraints (MIP-NLC). The MIP-NLC was solved using the Branch And Reduce Optimization Navigator (BARON) Solver [50], which is a system for solving non-convex optimization problems to global optimality. Finally, the network was simulated under the MaxPower, MinPower, OptPower, and HSRA setups.

Figure 6 shows the average output-queue length for three networks with 20 nodes each and increasing number of flows (i.e., 10 flows in Figure 6a, 15 flows in Figure 6b, and 20 flows in

Stability-Based Topology Control in Wireless Mesh Networks 41
Figure 6c). The input-queues have been omitted because they are guaranteed to always be stable [8, 11]. The flow rates in each network were all set at the same value. These are 8, 6, and 5 packets per frame for the networks in Figures 6a, 6b, and 6c respectively. These values were set so that their corresponding HSRA network became unstable if they were increased by at least one point. In this way, the network operates at a point inside the stability region and close to its boundary. Therefore, when any of the rates is increased by at least one point, the network operates outside the stability region, and therefore, it is unstable.

Figure 6. Average output-queue comparison for the HSRA, MinPower, MaxPower, and OptPower configurations
Close to the end of the simulation time, when the transient behavior of the queues is over, the average queue lengths of the different power setups (i.e., MaxPower, MinPower, OptPower, and HSRA) can be compared. In Figure 6a, the MaxPower setup has the worst performance (i.e., the largest average queue length), and the MinPower, OptPower, and HSRA have similar performance. Therefore, when the number of flows is low (i.e., 10 flows), the MinPower and the HSRA algorithms are able to achieve queue lengths that are close to the lengths achieved by the optimal solution (i.e., OptPower). On the other hand, when the number of flows increases, the MinPower algorithm does not achieve a performance close to the optimal one while the HSRA algorithm does. This is shown in Figures 6b and 6c. The MaxPower and MinPower algorithms have similar performance which is worse when compared with the HSRA algorithm. The HSRA algorithm achieves average queue lengths that are close to the lengths achieved by the optimal solution. Therefore, the HSRA algorithm enables the flows to carry more traffic while guaranteeing stability than the MaxPower and

MinPower algorithms do. Also, it is confirmed that the technique of only maximizing the spatial reuse by reducing the transmission ranges (i.e., MinPower) does not perform well when the flow density increases (i.e., when the number of flows increases and the number of nodes is kept constant.). On the other hand, the technique of adapting the stability region to the given set of flows by means of TP control (i.e., HSRA) does perform well when the flow density increases.
5. Conclusion
A new framework for the stability analysis of scheduling policies for wireless networks that allow the reservation of future data-subframes has been proposed. The concepts of inputqueue and output-queue were introduced into the framework in order to account for the packets waiting to be scheduled and the schedules assigned to these packets. Based on these concepts, sufficient conditions for the stability of RBDS wireless networks were found.
Within the proposed framework, an RBDS policy which uses the concept of greedy-maximal scheduling was analyzed. The nodes implement this policy by exchanging scheduling packets using the IEEE 802.16 election algorithm. A region in which the proposed reservation-based scheduling policy is stable was found using the framework. It was shown that the size of this region depends on a characteristic of the network topology (i.e., Qoj ).
The HSRA algorithm has been proposed for transmission power control. This algorithm increases the data-packet rates that flows can support and decreases the end-to-end delays. It is based on the adaptation of the stability region of a given link-scheduling policy when only the links that belong to a given set of flows are considered. The algorithm can be readily adapted to any link-scheduling policy whose stability region has been characterized, so it is not limited to any specific scheduling approach such as RTS/CTS-based policies. The improvement on throughput achieved by our algorithm was evaluated by means of. It was shown that it outperforms the classical solution of reducing transmission powers to increase spatial reuse.
Future lines of research include the development of a new framework for distributed topology-control algorithms. For example, this framework could based on a game-theoretical approach in which a given set of flows act as players that collaborate to maximize the packet rates they can support while guaranteeing stability. Also, based on the new framework, new distributed topology-control algorithms should be developed for IEEE 802.16 WMNs. Finally, the algorithms should be implemented and tested on WMN testbeds in order to evaluate the improvement in throughput they achieve in a real scenario.

1. Introduction
In this section, an overview of Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) is presented, and some unique features which distinguish WMNs from Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are listed. The main purpose of this chapter is discussed, and the contribution is presented along with the main features of this work.
1.1. Overview
The use of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) has grown tremendously in the past few years due to their ease of deployment and maintenance. However, the access points in these WLANs have to be connected to the backbone network through wired media. Wireless Mesh Networks offer an attractive alternative for providing broadband wireless Internet connectivity by using a wireless backhaul network and eliminating the need for extensive cabling. In traditional WLANs, each Access Point (AP) is connected to the wired network while only a subset of APs is connected to the wired network in WMNs. An AP that is connected to the wired network is called Gateway (GW); APs without wired connections are called Mesh Routers (MRs), and they connect to the GW through multiple hops. Like routers in a wired network, MRs in a WMN forward each other’s traffic to establish and maintain their connectivity. MRs and GWs are similar in design, with the only difference that a GW is directly connected to the wired network, while a MR is not. Figure 1 shows a sample mesh network in a typical enterprise such as a university [1]. The following are some unique features that distinguish WMNs from MANETs and WSNs [1].

 Mesh routers are static Mesh routers in a WMN are stationary; therefore, the route selection should focus on discovering links that interfere with as few nodes as possible to provide high end-to-end throughput.  Mesh routers have no power constraint In contrast to traditional wireless networks, such as MANETs and WSNs, where nodes are typically power-constrained, MRs have abundant power at their disposal.  Mesh routers have multiple radios With the reduced cost of radios, MRs can be equipped with multiple radios. Hence, simultaneous transmission and reception can be achieved using intelligent channel assignment to these radios.  The traffic model is different In MANETs, traffic can be from any peer Mobile Node (MN) to any other MN, while in WMNs, traffic is between MRs and the GW.  Traffic is concentrated along certain paths In MANETs, traffic distribution is generally assumed to be uniform, while in WMN, traffic is concentrated along the paths directed towards the GW.  Traffic volume is high MANETs have been designed essentially for enabling communication within a small group of people, while WMNs aim to provide high-bandwidth broadband connections to a large community, and thus should be able to accommodate a large number of users accessing the Internet. Due to high estimated traffic volume in WMNs, scalability and fault tolerance become important considerations in algorithm design.

Channel Assignment Using Topology Control Based on Power Control in Wireless Mesh Networks 49
1.2. Motivation
To the best of our knowledge, the proposed channel assignment algorithm is the first of its kind to use topology control based on power control for channel assignment in multi-radio multi-channel wireless mesh networks.
The main purpose of network topology control using power control is to minimize the interference between a MR and other MRs in the network by adjusting its transmission range using transmission power control. This leads to a better frequency reuse during channel assignment, which results in achieving the objective of significant improvement in the overall network throughput.
1.3. Contribution
Specifically, the contribution of this work is as follows: “A new Topology-controlled Interference-aware Channel-assignment Algorithm (TICA) which intelligently assigns the available non-overlapping 802.11a frequency channels to the mesh routers with the objective of minimizing interference and, thereby, improving network throughput.” The main features of this work are as follows.
 A Topology Control Algorithm (TCA) named Select x for less than x; that builds the network topology by selecting the nearest neighbors for each node in the network, with the objective of minimizing interference among MRs and enhancing frequency reuse.
 A scheme that uses the minimum power as the link weight when building the Shortest Path Tree (SPT) with the required node degree with the objective of minimizing interference and enhancing frequency reuse.
 A Channel Assignment Algorithm (CAA), TICA, which assigns the available nonoverlapping 802.11a frequency channels to the mesh nodes with the objective of improving the overall network throughput by minimizing interference between mesh nodes as well as ensuring connectivity between them. This work was first presented in [2].
 A centralized Failure Recovery Mechanism (FRM) for TICA which provides automatic and fast failure recovery by reorganizing the network in order to bypass the failed node and to restore connectivity. This work was first presented in [3].

2. Background
This section discusses the effects of topology control on the operation of a network, gives the taxonomy of the topology control schemes for multihop wireless networks, and presents some related well-known topology control algorithms. The section also contains a taxonomical classification of the channel assignment schemes for wireless mesh networks, and discusses some related well-known channel assignment algorithms for each class.
2.1. Topology control schemes
The importance of Topology Control (TC) lies in the fact that it affects network spatial reuse and hence the traffic carrying capacity. Choosing a large transmit power results in excessive interference, while choosing a small transmit power results in a disconnected network [5]. Using TC through transmission power control, the network connectivity and hence the network topology is affected, interference levels are mitigated, which reduces the co-channel interference, and the opportunity of spatial channel re-use is enhanced [6].
2.1.1. Topology control in multi-radio WMNs
The connectivity graph in a multi-radio WMN is determined through topology control. So, the problem of TC in multi-radio WMNs involves the selection of transmission power for each radio interface of each mesh node in the network, so as to maintain the network connectivity with the use of minimum power.
2.1.2. Effect of topology control
The problem of TC is complex, since the choice of the transmit power fundamentally affects many aspects of the operation of the network [7].
a. Effect of TC on the Performance of the Network
TC via transmission power control has a multi-dimensional effect on the performance of the whole network.
 The transmit power levels determine the performance of medium access control, since the spatial channel reuse depends on the number of other nodes within the interference range.
 The choices of power levels affect the connectivity of the network, and consequently the ability to deliver a packet to its destination [8].
 The power level affects the throughput capacity of the network [9].  Power control affects the network topology which affects the number of hops, and thus
the end-to-end delay.

Channel Assignment Using Topology Control Based on Power Control in Wireless Mesh Networks 51
b. Effect of TC on the Performance of the MAC and Routing Protocols
In addition, the assumption of fixed power levels is so ingrained into the design of many protocols in the OSI stack that changing the power levels results in their malfunctioning.
 Changing power levels can create uni-directional links, which can happen when a node i’s power level is high enough for a node j to hear it, but not vice versa.
 Bi-directionality of links is implicitly assumed in many routing protocols.  Medium access control protocols in IEEE 802.11 implicitly rely on bi-directionality as-
sumption of links.
2.1.3. Taxonomy of topology control schemes
These schemes are mainly divided into two types [10].
a. Homogeneous
This is the basic type of TC, as all the nodes are assumed to use the same transmitting range. So, the topology control problem reduces to determining the minimum value of transmission range that ensures network connectivity. This minimum transmission range is also called the Critical Transmitting Range (CTR).
b. Non-homogeneous
In this type of TC, nodes are allowed to choose different transmitting ranges, provided they do not exceed the maximum range. Depending on the type of information that is used to compute the topology, non-homogeneous topology control is further classified into three categories.
i. Location-based schemes
In such schemes, exact node positions are known. If this information is used by a centralized authority to compute a set of transmitting range assignments which optimizes a certain measure such as the energy cost, this is the case of the Range Assignment Problem and its variants. The Local Minimum Spanning Tree (LMST) algorithm [5] and the Enhanced Local Minimum Shortest-Path Tree (ELMST) algorithm [6] are examples of location-based topology control schemes.
ii. Direction-based schemes
In such schemes, it is assumed that nodes do not know their position, but they can estimate the relative direction of each of their neighbors.
iii. Neighbor-based schemes
In such schemes, nodes are assumed to know only the ID of the neighbors, and are able to order them according to some criterion such as link quality.

2.2. Channel assignment schemes
Channel Assignment (CA) in a multi-radio WMN environment consists of assigning channels to the radios in order to achieve efficient channel utilization (i.e. minimize cochannel interference) and, simultaneously, to guarantee an adequate level of connectivity. The problem of optimally assigning channels in an arbitrary mesh topology has been proven to be NP-hard, based on its mapping to a graph-coloring problem [11]. Therefore, channel assignment schemes employ heuristic techniques to assign channels to radios belonging to mesh nodes. A taxonomical classification of various CA schemes for wireless mesh networks is as follows [12].
2.2.1. Fixed channel assignment schemes
Fixed assignment schemes assign channels to radios either permanently, or for intervals that are long with respect to the radio switching time. Such schemes can be further subdivided into two types.
a. Common Channel Assignment (CCA)
In CCA scheme [13], the radios of each node are all assigned the same set of channels. For example, if each node has two radios, then the same two channels are used at every node. The main benefit is that the connectivity of the network is the same as that of a single channel approach, while the use of multiple channels increases network throughput. However, it does not take into account the effect of interference on the channel assignment in a WMN.
b. Varying Channel Assignment (VCA)
In the VCA class of schemes, the radios of different nodes are assigned different sets of channels. However, the assignment of channels may lead to network partitions and/or topology changes, which may increase the length of routes between mesh nodes. Therefore, in such a scheme, channel assignment needs to be carried out carefully. The VCA approach is discussed in more detail by presenting algorithms that belong to this category.
i. Centralized Hyacinth (C-HYA)
C-HYA, a centralized channel assignment algorithm for multi-radio multi-channel WMNs, was proposed in [11]. Assuming that the offered traffic load is known, this algorithm assigns channels ensuring network connectivity and satisfying the bandwidth limitations of each link.
ii. Mesh-based Traffic and interference-aware Channel-assignment (MesTiC)
MesTiC, a fixed algorithm for centralized CA, was proposed in [14], and visits nodes once in the decreasing order of their rank. The rank of each node is computed on the basis of its link-traffic characteristics, topological properties and number of radios on a node.

Channel Assignment Using Topology Control Based on Power Control in Wireless Mesh Networks 53
2.2.2. Dynamic channel assignment schemes
In dynamic CA schemes, any radio can be assigned any channel but additionally, radios can frequently switch from one channel to another. Therefore, when nodes need to communicate with each other in such a scheme, a coordination mechanism is required to ensure that they are on a common channel.
a. Multi-channel Medium Access Control (MMAC)
MMAC [15] [16] is a link-layer multi-channel protocol for nodes with a single network interface. A node equipped with a single interface can only listen to one channel at a time. Therefore, in order to use multiple channels, the interface has to be switched between channels.
When nodes require to switch channels, a pair of nodes need to listen on the same channel at the time of communication and a channel coordination method is necessary, which is not required in TICA.
b. Distributed Hyacinth (D-HYA)
D-HYA, a dynamic and distributed channel assignment algorithm proposed in [17], can adapt to traffic load dynamically. The algorithm builds on a spanning tree network topology. The gateway node is the root of the spanning tree, and every mesh node belongs to that tree. Based on per-channel total load information, a WMN node determines the set of channels that are least used in its vicinity. As nodes higher up in the spanning trees need more relay bandwidth, they are given a higher priority in channel assignment. The priority of a WMN node is equal to its hop distance from the gateway.
The CA schemes, such as C-HYA, MesTiC and D-HYA, require the traffic load to be known before assigning channels, whereas TICA requires no such knowledge for channel assignment.
2.2.3. Hybrid channel assignment schemes
Hybrid channel assignment schemes combine both static and dynamic assignment properties by applying a fixed assignment for some radios and a dynamic assignment for other radios. The fixed radios can be assigned dedicated channels while the other radios can be switched dynamically among channels.
a. Hybrid Multi-Channel Protocol (HMCP)
HMCP [18] [19] is a link-layer multi-channel protocol for nodes with multiple radio interfaces. Out of the available interfaces at each node, X interfaces are assigned statically to X channels, and these interfaces are designated as “fixed interfaces.” The fixed interfaces stay on the specified channels for long durations of time. The remaining interfaces can frequently switch between any of the remaining channels, based on the data traffic, and are designated as “switchable interfaces.”

54 Wireless Mesh Networks – Efficient Link Scheduling, Channel Assignment and Network Planning Strategies
A co-ordination protocol is required to decide what channel to assign to the fixed interface, and also for enabling neighbors of a node X to know about the channels used by fixed interface of node X. Time synchronization and coordination between mesh nodes which is required in HMCP is not needed in TICA.
b. Breadth First Search - Channel Assignment (BFS-CA)
BFS-CA [20] is a centralized, interference-aware algorithm aimed at improving the capacity of the WMN backbone and at minimizing interference. This algorithm is based on an extension to the conflict graph concept called the Multi-radio Conflict Graph (MCG) where the vertices in the MCG represent edges between radios instead of edges between mesh routers.
BFS-CA requires certain number of MRs with certain number of radio interfaces to be placed at certain hops from the gateway, whereas TICA simply requires all MRs to have four data radios, does not require any careful router placement strategy, and works with any placement of routers as verified by a comprehensive performance evaluation.
3. Channel assignment problem
In this section, the medium access issues encountered by IEEE 802.11-based single-radio single-channel WMNs are presented, and a multiple-channel approach using multiple radios to overcome these problems is discussed. The key issue of channel assignment in Multi-Radio Multi-Channel (MRMC) WMNs is presented, along with its objectives and constraints.
3.1. IEEE 802.11 medium access issues
Since the WMN has to provide access to broadband Internet, it is expected to have higher bandwidth. Even though the physical layer can support very high bit rate, current MAC protocols are not able to utilize the entire bandwidth provided by the physical layer. The main reason for this poor performance is the suboptimal media access protocols, which were primarily designed for single-hop networks [1].
3.1.1. Hidden and exposed terminal problems
IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) is one such widely accepted MAC protocol but, when used in a multihop network scenario, it results in poor performance and is therefore unacceptable. The reason is that some nodes remain starved due to hidden and exposed terminals in a multihop environment. Figure 2 illustrates these problems [1].
Node 2, which is outside the interference range of Node 3 and unaware of the ongoing transmission at Node 3, continues to send RTS to Node 1 causing collision. This is a case of the hidden terminal problem.
Node 4 is prevented from transmitting because of the neighboring transmission at Node 3. This is a case of the exposed terminal problem.

Channel Assignment Using Topology Control Based on Power Control in Wireless Mesh Networks 55
Figure 2. Hidden and exposed terminal problems [1]
3.2. Wireless mesh network architectures 3.2.1. Single-radio single-channel mesh network
A Single-Radio Single-Channel (SRSC) mesh architecture suffers from hidden and exposed terminal problems. Assigning orthogonal channels to the MRs within the interference range can help alleviate the hidden and exposed terminal problems, and assist in improving the overall capacity of the network. However, considering the traffic characteristics in a WMN, frequent channel switching may be required to communicate with neighboring nodes. In such scenarios, single-radio multi-channel MAC may not provide any significant performance gains due to high channel switching delay.
3.2.2. Multi-radio multi-channel mesh network
The use of a multi-channel approach using multiple radios overcomes the problems encountered in the previous architectures [1]. Two or more radios are employed for the backhaul link. The uplink and downlink backhaul radios operate at non-overlapping channels which eliminates the co-channel interference. As each mesh router can be equipped with multiple radios, fixed channel assignment to these radios is a more viable solution. Efficient and intelligent channel assignment schemes have to be designed, as the number of channels is limited.
3.3. Channel assignment problem
In a typical WMN, the total number of radios is much higher than the number of available channels. Thus, many links between the mesh routers operate on the same set of channels and interference among transmissions on these channels decreases their utilization. Therefore, minimizing the effect of interference is required for the efficient reuse of the

56 Wireless Mesh Networks – Efficient Link Scheduling, Channel Assignment and Network Planning Strategies
scarce radio spectrum. So, the key issue in a MRMC WMN architecture is the channel assignment problem, which involves assigning a channel to each radio of a MR in a way that minimizes interference on any given channel and guarantees connectivity between the mesh nodes [12].
Given the connectivity graph, the main challenge for CAA is to assign a channel to each radio in a way that minimizes interference between MRs and ensures connectivity between them. In order to achieve these goals, the CAA should satisfy the following requirements.
1. In order to communicate, a pair of nodes within transmission range of each other needs to have a common channel assigned to their end-point radios.
2. Links in direct interference range of each other should be assigned non-overlapping channels.
3. The number of distinct channels that can be assigned to a mesh router is bounded by the number of radios it has.
4. The total number of non-overlapping channels is fixed. 5. Since the traffic in a WMN is directed to and from the gateway, the traffic flows aggre-
gate at routers close to the gateway. Therefore, priority in channel assignment should be given to links starting from the gateway based on the number of nodes that use a link to reach the gateway.
At first glance, the problem of assigning channels to links in a mesh network appears to be a graph-coloring problem. However, standard graph-coloring algorithms cannot satisfy all of its constraints, and it is NP-hard to find an optimal channel assignment to maximize the overall network throughput [11]. Also, the channel assignment problem for mesh networks is similar to the list coloring problem, which is NP-complete [21].
4. Topology control and channel assignment algorithms
In this section, the network architecture of the proposed model is presented. The section presents the proposed topology control and channel assignment algorithms for MRMC WMNs, and details on the working of different phases of the proposed algorithms are discussed. The procedure of fault recovery with the proposed CAA is also presented in this section.
4.1. Network architecture
In our proposed model, each mesh router is equipped with five radios which operate on IEEE 802.11a channels (5 GHz band). One of these radios is used for control purpose while other radios are used for data traffic.
The control radios of all mesh nodes operate on the same non-overlapping IEEE 802.11a channel. Out of the 12 available non-overlapping 802.11a channels, channel 12 is used as the common control channel. Each mesh router is equipped with 4 data radios in order to utilize the remaining 11 non-overlapping channels available in IEEE 802.11a frequency band. Each MR communicates with its transmission range (TR) neighbors using these data radios for data transmission. So, each MR can have a maximum of 4 TR neighbors with whom it can

Channel Assignment Using Topology Control Based on Power Control in Wireless Mesh Networks 57
communicate for data transmission which implies that the Maximum Node Degree (MND) per node is four. The MND of 4 is selected in order to fully utilize the 11 available non-overlapping 802.11a frequency channels. Results have shown that with 12 available non-overlapping channels, the network throughput increases until a MND of four but saturates after that [11].
4.2. Topology control algorithm
The proposed Topology Control Algorithm (TCA) controls the network topology by selecting the nearest neighbors for each node in the network. The objective of the proposed TCA is to build a connectivity graph with a small node degree to mitigate the co-channel interference and enhance spatial channel reuse as well as preserve network connectivity with the use of minimal power, as less transmit power translates to less interference.
4.2.1. Gateway advertisement process
Initially, the gateway broadcasts a “Hello” message, using its control radio on the control channel, announcing itself as the gateway. Each mesh node that receives this Hello message over its control radio broadcasts it again and in this way, this Hello message is flooded throughout the mesh network. The Hello message contains a hop-count field that is incremented at each hop during its broadcast. So, a mesh node may receive multiple copies of the Hello message over its control radio. However, distance of a mesh node from the gateway is the shortest path length (shortest hop count) of the Hello message received by a mesh node through its control radio over different paths. In this way, each mesh node knows the next hop to reach the gateway using its control radio.
4.2.2. Assumptions
The proposed TCA assumes the following.
 Each node knows its location.  Each node uses an omni-directional antenna for both transmission and reception.  Each node is able to adjust its own transmission power.  The maximum transmission power is the same for all nodes and hence, the maximum
TR for any pair of nodes to communicate directly is also the same.
Note that all nodes start with the maximum transmission power, and that the initial topology graph created, when every node transmits with full power, is strongly connected.
4.2.3. Phases of TCA
The proposed TCA consists of the following five phases.
a. Exchange of Information Between Nodes
In the first exchange, each node broadcasts a HELLO message at maximum transmission power containing its node ID and the node position.

58 Wireless Mesh Networks – Efficient Link Scheduling, Channel Assignment and Network Planning Strategies
b. Building the Maximum Power Neighbor Table (MPNT)
From the information in the received HELLO messages, each node arranges its neighboring nodes in the ascending order of their distance. The result is the Maximum Power Neighbor Table (MPNT). Then, each node sends its MPNT along with its position and node ID to the gateway node using its control radio over the control channel.
c. Building the Direct Neighbor Table (DNT)
For each node in the network, the gateway builds a Direct Neighbor Table (DNT). Based on information in the MPNT of node v and the MPNTs of its neighbors, if
(a) node w is in the MPNT of node v, and (b) node w is closer to any other node y in the MPNT of node w than to node v, then gateway eliminates node w from the MPNT of node v.
If, after removing nodes from the MPNT of node v, the remaining number of nodes in the MPNT of node v is less than “x,” then the gateway selects “x” nearest nodes as neighbors of node v which results in the DNT. However, if after removing nodes from the MPNT of node v, the remaining number of nodes is greater than or equal to “x,” then the result is the DNT.
This algorithm is called Select x for less than x TCA where x is a positive integer. The Select x for less than x TCA ensures that each node has at least x neighbors, as shown in Figure 3.
d. Converting into Bi-directional Links
For each node in the network, the gateway converts the uni-directional links in the DNT of a node into bi-directional links. For each uni-directional link, this is done by adding a reverse link in the DNT of the neighboring node. This converts the DNT into Bi-directional DNT. This results in the Final Neighbor Table (FNT).
e. Calculating the Minimum Power Required
For each node in the network, the gateway calculates the minimum power, Pmin, required to reach each of the nodes in the FNT of a node, using the appropriate propagation model.

4.2.4. Propagation models
The free space model is used for short distances and the two ray ground reflection model is used for longer distances, depending on the value of the Euclidean distance in relation to the cross-over distance. The cross-over distance is calculated by [22]

If the distance between two nodes is less than the cross over distance, i.e. d(u,v) < Cross_over_dist, Free Space propagation model is used, whereas if d(u,v) > Cross_over_dist, Two-ray propagation model is used. The minimum power for the free-space propagation model is calculated by [22]

4.3. Channel assignment algorithm
4.3.1. Interference-range edge coloring
If K be the number of available colors (channels), then for K ≥ 4, the distance-2 edge coloring problem, also known as strong edge coloring problem, is NP-complete [23]. A distance-2 edge coloring of a graph G is an assignment of colors to edges so that any two edges within distance 2 of each other have distinct colors. Two edges of G are within distance 2 of each other if either they are adjacent, as shown in Figure 4a or there is some other edge that is adjacent to both of them, as shown in Figure 4b. The distance-2 edge coloring has been used in [24] for channel assignment, where the authors have described the interference model as two-hop interference model. In this model, two edges interfere with each other if they are within two-hop distance. In other words, two edges e1 and e2 cannot transmit simultaneously on the same channel if they are sharing a node or are adjacent to a common edge.
To minimize co-channel interference in a wireless mesh network, it is necessary to assign channels to links such that links within interference range of each other are assigned different channels (colors). This problem can be termed as interference-range edge coloring, and the corresponding interference model can be called interference-range interference model. In a grid topology where links are of equal length, the interference-range edge coloring is similar to distance-2 edge coloring, as shown in Figure 5a. The channel assigned to link l1 cannot be assigned to links l2 and l3 as they are within the interference range of link l1. Note that l2 and l3 are also within two-hop distance of l1.
However, in a random topology where links are of different lengths due to the random nature of the topology, the interference-range edge coloring can be harder than distance-2 edge coloring as shown in Figure 5b. In this case, the channel assigned to link l1 cannot be assigned to links l2, l3 and l4 as they are within the interference range of link l1. Note that l2, l3 and l4 are within three-hop distance of l1.
In the proposed network model, the number of available channels (colors) is 11 which means that K = 11. Based on its similarity to distance-2 edge coloring problem which is NPcomplete for K ≥ 4, the interference-range edge coloring problem is, therefore, also NP-

Channel Assignment Using Topology Control Based on Power Control in Wireless Mesh Networks 61
complete. Therefore, we propose an approximate algorithm for channel assignment. The proposed channel assignment algorithm, TICA, is shown in Figure 6 and has the following phases.
Figure 4. Two edges at distance-2 of each other [23]
Figure 5. Interference-range edge coloring
4.3.2. Phases of TICA
a. Topology Control In order to create the network connectivity graph with the aim of reducing the interference between MRs, network topology is controlled using the topology control algorithm. All nodes send their MPNTs to the gateway using their control radio. Note that in order to send its MPNT to the gateway, each mesh node knows the next hop to reach the gateway using its control radio via the “gateway advertisement process.” The gateway starts with the Select 1 for less than 1 TCA and builds the FNTs of all nodes.

62 Wireless Mesh Networks – Efficient Link Scheduling, Channel Assignment and Network Planning Strategies

b. Connectivity Graph
Based on the FNTs of all nodes, the gateway builds the connectivity graph and checks the resulting network for connectivity. A topology is said to be connected if the gateway can reach any node in the connectivity graph directly or through intermediate hops.
If the resulting network is not connected, the gateway moves to the next higher TCA by incrementing x in the Select x for less than x TCA, builds the connectivity graph and checks the resulting network for connectivity. The gateway keeps on moving to a higher TCA until it finds that the network resulting from the connectivity graph is connected.
c. Minimum Power-based Shortest Path Tree with a MND of Four
After ensuring that the connectivity graph is connected, the gateway builds the Shortest Path Tree (SPT), using Dijkstra’s algorithm [25], based on the connectivity graph. The metric for path selection is minimum power.
The node degree is defined as the number of TR neighbors of a node. The number of TR neighbors of a mesh router is bounded by the number of its radios and each node has four data radios. So, if any node in the shortest path tree has more than four links, the gateway selects those four links for that node which have the minimum weight and sets the weight of all other links to infinity. In other words, the gateway ensures that each node can have a maximum of four TR neighbors and builds a Minimum Power-based SPT (MPSPT) with a MND of 4 per node. The gateway checks the resulting MPSPT graph for connectivity. If the resulting MPSPT graph is not connected, the gateway moves to a higher TCA.
Once the MPSPT graph is determined, the gateway has to assign channels to links of the MPSPT. Now, the objective is to assign channels to the links of the MPSPT such that the interference between simultaneous transmissions on links operating on the same channel is minimized and the overall network throughput is maximized.
d. Link Ranking
In order to assign channels to the links of the MPSPT graph, each link is assigned a ranking by the gateway. The ranking associated with each link is derived from the number of nodes that use a link to reach the gateway node. If l is link and n is node using link l to reach the gateway, then rank of link l, i.e. rl, is given by

N

 rl  In,l ,

(4)

n1

where N is the total number of nodes in the network. In,l is 1 if node n is using link l and 0 otherwise.

In the case of two or more links that have the same rank, the link whose power of the farthest node to the gateway is smaller is given priority in channel assignment. If there are some links that still have the same rank, the link with smaller node IDs is given priority in channel assignment.

Channel Assignment Using Topology Control Based on Power Control in Wireless Mesh Networks 63

e. Channel Assignment
The gateway assigns a channel to each link in the order of its rank, and it begins with assigning the 11 available non-overlapping channels to the 11 highest-ranked links such that Channel 1 is assigned to the highest-ranked link. For the 12th-ranked link and onwards, the gateway checks the channel assignment of all links within the interference range of both nodes that constitute that link.
i. Non-conflicting Channel
Out of the 11 available channels, channels which are not assigned to any link within the interference range of both nodes that constitute the 12th-ranked link are termed as nonconflicting channels. If the gateway finds one or more non-conflicting channels, it assigns that channel from the unassigned non-conflicting channels to the 12th-ranked link which has the highest channel number.
ii. Least Interfering Channel
If the gateway cannot find any channel among the 11 available channels that is not assigned to any link within the interference range of both nodes that constitute the 12th-ranked link, it selects the least interfering channel and assigns it to that link. A Least Interfering Channel (LIC) is a channel which causes minimum interference within the interference range of both nodes that constitute the 12th-ranked link.
iii. Interference Level
In order to find out the LIC, the gateway builds the interference level (IL) for all the 11 channels. The LIC is the channel with the minimum IL, which means that assigning this channel to the 12th-ranked link would result in minimum interference in the network.
In order to build the IL for Channel One, the gateway finds all links within the interference range of each of the two nodes that constitute the 12th-ranked link that use Channel One, and calculates IL of each link based on its rank and distance from a node of the 12th-ranked link. It sums up individual ILs of all links that use Channel One within the interference range of each of the two nodes that constitute the 12th-ranked link, to find out total IL for Channel One. This is done by

Similarly, the gateway assigns channels to all the links of the MPSPT.

iv. Channel Assignment and Routing Message

Using its control radio, the gateway then sends each mesh node the Channel Assignment and Routing Message (CARM). For each channel assigned to a mesh router, CARM contains the channel number and the neighbor node to communicate with, using this channel. The CARM also contains the next hop to reach the gateway for data traffic. Based on the channel assigned to a mesh router to communicate with a neighbor and its distance to that neighbor, the mesh router applies power control and adjusts its transmission power accordingly by using the appropriate propagation model.

4.3.3. Failure recovery mechanism of TICA
When a node fails, nodes in its sub-tree lose their connectivity to the gateway and hence, the Internet through the wired world. TICA supports automatic and fast failure recovery and reorganizes the network to bypass the failed node and to restore the connectivity. In case of node failure, the FRM of TICA, which is shown in Figure 7, is initiated by the gateway.
All nodes send periodic "keep-alive" messages to the gateway on the control channel using their control radios. The keep-alive message from a node tells the gateway that the node is active. If the gateway does not receive three consecutive keep-alives from a node z, then it concludes that node z has failed and is no longer active. The gateway then deletes the MPNT for this node and deletes node z from the MPNT of all its neighboring nodes. Note that the gateway has MPNTs of all nodes, as all nodes sent their MPNTs to the gateway during the setup phase. The gateway builds the FNTs for all nodes using the Select x for less than x TCA.
Based on the FNTs of all nodes, the gateway builds the connectivity graph, the MPSPT with a MND of four, the link ranking for the links of the MPSPT and assigns the channels to all links of the MPSPT. The gateway then sends the new CARM to all nodes in the network on the control channel.

5. Performance evaluation
In this section, the performance evaluation of the proposed channel assignment algorithm is provided. Different topologies used for performance evaluation are presented. The performance of the proposed channel assignment algorithm for MRMC WMNs is compared against a “Single-Radio Single-Channel” (SRSC) scheme and a “Common Channel

Assignment” (CCA) scheme for multi-radio mesh nodes. The detailed results of simulations for performance evaluation of TICA based on throughput analysis of a 36-node network are presented, and analyzed. The features' comparison of TICA with related well known channel assignment schemes is also given.
5.1. Simulation environment
For the performance evaluation via throughput analysis, NS2 (version 2.30) [26] simulation tool is used. However, MATLAB [27] is used to generate the power controlled topology, the MPSPT graph, the link ranking of the MPSPT and the channel assignment for the links of the MPSPT.
Multi-interface wireless mesh nodes are created in NS2 by modifying the built-in IEEE 802.11 node model in NS2, using the procedure given in [28]. Based on the channel assignment by the gateway, the radio interfaces are configured for each node and the transmission power for each radio of each mesh node is set accordingly. All the mesh nodes at the periphery of the network send traffic to the gateway. Each of these nodes generates an 8 Mbps Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic stream consisting of 1024 byte packets, and sends data to the gateway node at the same time. They do not stop transmitting until the end of the simulation. So, this is a scenario in which multiple flows within the mesh network interfere with each other.
All radios are IEEE 802.11a radios and support 12 channels. The first 11 non-overlapping channels are used by the data radios, whereas the 12th channel is used by the control radio on each node. If the distance between the nodes is less than the cross-over distance, free space propagation model is used; if the distance between the nodes is greater than the crossover distance, two-ray propagation model is used. As per [4], the minimum receiver sensitivity (RxThresh) is set to -65 dBm ( 3.16227 10-10 Watts) in order to achieve a maximum data rate of 54 Mbps supported by IEEE 802.11a.
In order to achieve a strongly connected topology, the maximum transmission power for all the radios is set to 27 dBm. The maximum power transmission range is 164 meters and the maximum power interference range is 328 meters. RTS/CTS is disabled. Note that in the CCA and SRSC schemes, the mesh nodes do not control their power, transmit with the same maximum power (27 dBm) and use AODV (Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector) [29] routing protocol as their routing agent.
5.2. Network topologies
Three types of topologies are used in the evaluation. Each topology consists of 36 mesh nodes distributed in an area of 500x500 meters.
Topology 1 is a grid topology; Topology 2 is a randomly generated topology while in Topology 3, called controlled random, the physical terrain is divided into a number of cells and a mesh node is placed randomly within each cell.

Channel Assignment Using Topology Control Based on Power Control in Wireless Mesh Networks 67 Figure 7. Failure Recovery Mechanism of TICA

68 Wireless Mesh Networks – Efficient Link Scheduling, Channel Assignment and Network Planning Strategies
Grid Topology (GT) is used to evaluate TICA in a densely populated topology. Random Topology (RT) is used to evaluate TICA in an unplanned deployment of randomly and uniformly distributed mesh nodes. Controlled Random Topology (CRT) is used to reflect realworld deployments where mesh routers are uniformly distributed for maximum coverage.

5.3. Simulation results based on throughput analysis
5.3.1. Simulation parameters
The physical layer and MAC layer settings of the node which are used during the simulation are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Note that out of the 12 available nonoverlapping 802.11a channels, 11 channels are used for data traffic and channel 12 is used for control. Based on the channel assignment by the gateway node, IEEE 802.11a channels are assigned to the links between the mesh nodes and transmission power for each radio of each mesh node is set accordingly.

As mentioned earlier, the maximum transmission power for all the radios is 27 dBm. In the CCA and SRSC schemes, MRs do not control their power, transmit with the same maximum power (27 dBm), and use AODV (Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector) routing protocol as their routing agent.

All the mesh nodes at the periphery of the network send traffic to the gateway. Each of these nodes generates an 8 Mbps Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic stream consisting of 1024 byte packets and sends data to the gateway node at the same time. They do not stop transmitting until the end of the simulation, which is 600 seconds (10 minutes).

a. Random Topology

Figure 8 shows a graphical comparison of the average throughput of all schemes for ten random topologies. The results in this figure clearly indicate that the proposed algorithm TICA significantly outperforms other schemes for all different random topologies.

b. Controlled Random Topology

Figure 9 shows a graphical comparison of average throughput of all schemes for ten controlled random topologies. The results in this figure clearly indicate that the proposed algorithm TICA significantly outperforms other schemes for all different controlled random topologies.

The placement of the nodes and hence, the length of links in the MPSPT of a topology affects the interference range and hence, the channel assignment. In random and controlled random topologies, the random placement of nodes results in variation in the length of links in the MPSPT. This results in LICs, which may cause significant interference in the network and degrade the overall throughput.

c. Throughput Comparison for the three topologies

Figure 10 shows the comparison of average throughput of all schemes for the three topologies (random, controlled random and grid) for a network of 36 nodes.

Note that for random and controlled random topologies in Figure 10, the average throughput is the average over ten different random and controlled random topologies, respectively. Figure 10 shows that as compared to the CCA scheme, the throughput improvement with TICA is 3 times for random topology, 11 times for controlled random topology and 12 times for grid topology. In comparison to the SRSC scheme, the throughput improvement with TICA is 8 times for random topology, 95 times for controlled random topology and 133 times for grid topology.

The results in this figure clearly indicate that the proposed algorithm, TICA, significantly outperforms other schemes for the three topologies.

5.4. Features’ comparison of related CA schemes
The important features of the related CA schemes are summarized in Table 3. They include channel switching, topology control, power control, knowledge of traffic load, connectivity, fault tolerance and CA control. The most significant difference between TICA and existing CA schemes is that TICA uses topology control based on power control to build the topology for CA with the objective of minimizing the interference between the MRs whereas no other CA scheme has used topology control based on power control for CA. Another significant difference between TICA and most other existing CA schemes is that TICA performs routing in addition to CA whereas most other CA schemes rely on routing protocols and complicated routing metrics for route selection. Unlike TICA and D-HYA, other well-known CA schemes do not possess fault tolerance and have not provided any mechanism for recovery after a node failure.
6. Conclusion and future work
The chapter finally concludes in this section along with some directions for future work.

72 Wireless Mesh Networks – Efficient Link Scheduling, Channel Assignment and Network Planning Strategies
6.1. Conclusions
 A new topology control algorithm for multi-radio WMNs, Select x for less than x, is proposed. It controls the network topology by selecting the nearest neighbors for each node in the network.
 A new channel assignment algorithm for MRMC IEEE 802.11a-based WMNs, TICA, is proposed, which is based on topology control. As verified by a comprehensive performance evaluation, the improvement in the overall network throughput with TICA is significantly higher than the CCA scheme but is much higher than SRSC scheme in all three topologies. This is due to the fact that topology control based on power control results in an efficient frequency reuse during CA, which leads to an overall improvement in the network throughput. In the CCA and SRSC schemes, which are two commonly-used benchmark schemes, MRs do not control their power, transmit with maximum power, and use AODV routing protocol as their routing agent. TICA, on the other hand, uses topology control by selecting the nearest neighbors for each mesh node in the network, which reduces the interference among the mesh routers. It uses the minimum power as the link weight when building the SPT with the required node degree as less power translates to less interference among the mesh routers. It uses a scheme to build the IL for all the frequency channels if all the available frequency channels have already been assigned within the interference range of a link. It assigns a LIC to a link if all the available frequency channels have already been assigned within the interference range of that link. LIC is the channel with the minimum IL, which means that assigning this channel to the link would result in minimum interference in the network. In TICA, from the information in the received CARM, each mesh router applies power control and adjusts its transmission power accordingly, based on the channel assigned to that mesh router to communicate with a neighbor and its distance to that neighbor.
 As per the specification of the IEEE 802.11s standard for wireless mesh networks, the mesh routing protocol has to reside in the MAC layer. TICA not only performs channel assignment but performs routing as well by providing each node with the next hop information to reach the gateway node and hence, conforms to the requirements of IEEE 802.11s.
 A centralized Failure Recovery Mechanism for TICA is proposed, which supports automatic and fast failure recovery. In case of node failure, after detecting the failed node, deleting the MPNT of the failed node and deleting it from the MPNT of its neighbors, the gateway runs the TCA and builds the MPSPT. Based on the new MPSPT, the gateway calculates the link rankings and the channel assignments. The new channel assignments are communicated to the mesh nodes by the gateway via a new CARM using the control radio over the control channel.
 The proposed CA algorithm, TICA, does not require modifications to the MAC protocol and therefore, can work with existing IEEE 802.11a-based interface hardware.

6.2. Future work
Following are some aspects of this work which can be extended in future.
 Since TICA uses the new approach of building the interference level for all the frequency channels, it can be enhanced to model and account for the interference from colocated wireless networks.
 Other algorithms for building the tree topology, such as Prim’s algorithm [30] and Kruskal’s algorithm [31], can be used for building the minimum power based tree, which may lead to a further enhancement in the overall network throughput.

 Other schemes for building the tree topology with the required node degree, such as the one proposed in [32], can be used which may lead to a better performance.
 The propagation model used is free-space model or two-ray model depending upon the cross-over distance. The performance of the proposed algorithm may be tested under more realistic propagation models such as Shadowing, Rayleigh-fading.
 The carrier sensing range is generally assumed to be twice the transmission range. However, carrier sensing range is a tunable parameter and an optimally tuned carrier sensing range can improve the network throughput in wireless mesh networks by enhancing the spatial frequency reuse and reducing collisions [33]. The performance of the proposed algorithm can be improved by controlling the carrier sensing range.
 The phenomenon of topology control based on power control impacts the per-node fairness of medium access based on CSMA/CA and hence the per-flow end-to-end throughput fairness [34]. The proposed algorithm can be extended to ensure per-node and hence per-flow fairness.
 All the traffic in a WMN is directed towards the gateway. The traffic bottleneck at the gateway is the main reason of the capacity limitation of a WMN. The use of multiple gateways can increase the capacity of the WMN by preventing the formation of traffic bottlenecks [35]. The proposed algorithm can be enhanced by extending it for multiple gateways.

1. Introduction
In recent years, wireless mesh networks (WMNs) were deployed as a type of next generation wireless broadband networks. WMNs provide wireless broadband accessibility to extend the Internet connectivity to the last mile and improve the network coverage. WMN consists of a set of mesh routers and mesh clients (Fig. 1). Mesh routers are usually stationary and form multi-hop wireless backbone network (i.e. mesh routers are interconnected with each other via wireless medium). Some or all of the mesh routers also serve as access points for mobile users (mesh clients) under their coverage. Usually one or more mesh routers have direct connections to wired network and serve as Internet gateways for the rest of the network. These nodes are called mesh gateways. Compared to traditional wireless LANs, the main feature of WMNs is their multi-hop wireless backbone capability (Conti et al., 2007). Traditionally, wireless networks are equipped with only one IEEE 802.11 radio interface. However, a single-interface inherently restricts the whole network by using only one single channel (Fig. 3a). In order to communicate successfully, two neighboring routers have to build a logical link which operates on a common channel. Due to that, all wireless nodes have to use only one radio interface, all logical links in network must use the same channel. If two neighboring links operate on the same channel and transfer data simultaneously, then they definitely interfere with each other. The network capacity and the performance may degrade significantly because of the interference (Gupta & Kumar, 2000). The key factor for reducing the effect of interference is the using of non-overlapping channels (standard IEEE 802.11b/g provides 3 and standard IEEE 802.11a up to 12 non-overlapping channels) (Ramachandran et al., 2006). In practice, IEEE 802.11b/g defines 11 communication channels (number of communication channels varies due to regulations of different countries) but only 3 of them are non-overlapping (Fig.2).

80 Wireless Mesh Networks – Efficient Link Scheduling, Channel Assignment and Network Planning Strategies

Figure 1. WMN architecture

Non-overlapping channels

Figure 2. Channel spectrum occupation in IEEE 802.11b/g
Using multiple non-overlapping channels in single interface network disconnects the subset of nodes using one channel from other nodes that are not using the same channel (Fig. 3b). For this reason this approach generally requires MAC layer modification and per packet channel switching capability for radio interfaces (Marina & Das, 2005). Before every data transmission a channel selection mechanism evaluates the available channels and selects a channel to transmit. There are also some problems introduced with channel switching mechanism. These problems include multi-channel hidden terminal problem, broadcast problem, deafness problem and channel deadlock problem (Raniwala et al., 2004).

Channel Assignment Schemes Optimization for Multi-Interface Wireless Mesh Networks Based on Link Load 81
One of the most promising approaches lies in using multiple radio interfaces and multiple non-overlapping channels (Fig. 3c). This solution is better than previous one, because of providing the effective usage of given frequency spectrum (Conti et al., 2007). This architecture overcomes deficiencies of single interface solution. It allows using of multiple interfaces per node to allow the simultaneous transmission and reception on different radio interfaces tuned to different channels, which can essentially improve network capacity. However, the number of radio interfaces is always much higher than the number of effective channels, which causes an existence of many different links between mesh routers operating on the same channel. For this reason, the suitable channel assignment method is needed to maintain the connectivity between mesh nodes and to minimize the effect of interference (Raniwala et al., 2004). The channel assignment (CA) in a multi-interface WMN consists of a task to assign channels to the radio interfaces by such a way to achieve efficient channel utilization and to minimize the interference. The problem of optimally assigning channels in an arbitrary mesh topology has been proved to be NP-hard (non-deterministic polynomial-time hard) based on its mapping to a graph-coloring problem. Therefore, channel assignment schemes predominantly employ heuristic techniques to assign channels to radio interfaces belonging to WMN nodes. The channel assignment algorithms can be divided into three main categories: fixed, dynamic and hybrid, depending on the frequency with which it is modified by the channel assignment scheme. In a fixed scheme, the CA is almost constant, while in a dynamic one it is continuously updated to improve performance. A hybrid scheme applies a fixed scheme for some radio interfaces and dynamic one for the others (Yulong Chen et al., 2010).

The main objective of this chapter is to give to reader the compact information about problems connected with optimal using of radio interfaces and radio channels in wireless mesh networks. The optimal using is computed from several different points of view, e.g. network topology, number of data flows, number of nodes by comparison of selected QoS

parameters. In the second part of the chapter, the new proposed centralized channel assignment concept called First Random Channel Assignment algorithm (FRCA) is compared with two other channel assignment techniques (CCA, LACA) by the same QoS parameters.
The rest of this chapter is organized as follows. In section 2, the related work is summarized. In section 3, the methods and simulation results to find the optimal number of radio interfaces per node are introduced. In section 4 the mathematical background and graph based mathematical model is described and in the next section different types of channel assignment methods based on links load are analyzed. Section 6 concludes the chapter.
2. Related work
There exist a large number of studies which address the channel assignment problem in wireless mesh networks. Several works have proposed MAC protocols for utilizing multiple channels (So & Vaidya, 2004, Gong & Midkiff, 2005), but these multi-channel protocols require changes to existing standards and therefore cannot be deployed by using existing hardware. In (Adya et al., 2004) was proposed a link-layer solution for transmitting data over multiple radio interfaces, but this approach is designed for scenario where the number of radio interfaces is equal to the number of channels. In (Gupta & Kumar, 2000) the performance of multi-channel ad-hoc networks was studied, where each channel was assigned to an interface. In (Draves et al., 2004) several methods for increasing the performance in single-channel per interface were proposed. The most studies is focused only to one problem to find the efficient channel assignment method, but did not suggest the optimal number of radio interfaces per node. In (Husnain et al., 2004) were compared different static centralized algorithms, but for evaluation of optimal number of radio interfaces was used only one parameter - total interference (number of links in conflict graph). (Raniwala et al., 2004) proposed centralized channel assignment and routing method, where results about number of radio interfaces were shown but only for network cross-section goodput. In (Chi Moon Oh et al., 2008) the study of optimal number of radio interfaces was created but only for grid network, using simple channel assignment method and for one QoS parameter (throughput).
3. The study of optimal number of radio interfaces
In this section several simulations were created to find the optimal number of radio interfaces for static WMN. In this study we focus only to one problem - to find the optimal number of radio interfaces for different conditions therefore, for channel assignment we used simple CCA approach (section 5.1).
Nowadays the availability of the cheap off-the-shelf commodity hardware also makes multiradio solutions economically attractive. This condition provides the using much more radio interfaces per node, which shows the investigating of optimal number of interfaces as a reasonable argument.

We have included in our simulations several QoS parameters, data flows, number of nodes and network topologies to find the optimum number of radio interfaces for services which required the real time transmission (e.g. video conference).

3.1. Simulation environment
A simulation WMN model was developed in NS-2 network simulator, with additional function to support multi-channel and multi-interface solution (Calvo & Campo, 2007). Each mesh node used the number of interfaces between 1 to 8 and the same number of channels. Two different network topologies were created. The first one was grid topology, which consisted of 25 static wireless mesh nodes placed in an area of 1000 x 1000 meters. Transmission range for each node was set to 200 meters (Fig.4a). The second topology consists of 25 nodes, which were randomly placed in an area of 1000 x 1000 meters (Fig.4b). For simulation evaluations, ten random topologies and computed average values of chosen QoS parameters were studied. We have used the WMN with 25 nodes, because of the typical number of mesh nodes in WMN (25 to 30) (Skalli et al., 2006). For traffic generation, 5 CBR (Constant Bit Rate) flows were used and the packet size was set to 512 bytes. The same radio default parameters as in (ns-2, 2008) were used, except that we set the channel data rate to 11 Mbit/s. Simulation parameters are summarized in Table 1.

3.2. Simulation results
In this section results of experiments are presented. The purpose of simulation was to determine the optimal number of radio interfaces for different WMN topologies, different number of data flows and different number of nodes to achieve the network capacity increasing expressed in enhancement of QoS parameters.
We chose four QoS parameters for simulation evaluation:
 Average End-to-end Delay: The average time taken for a packet to reach the destination. It includes all possible delays in the source node and in each intermediate host, caused by queuing at the interface queue, transmission at the MAC layer, routing discovery, etc. Only successfully delivered packets are counted.
 Average Throughput: The sum of data packets delivered to all nodes in the network in a given time unit (second).
 Packet Loss: Occurs when one or more packets being transmitted across the network fail to arrive at the destination.
 Average Jitter: The delay variations between all received data packets.

3.2.1. Different network topologies

In this simulation we created two different network topologies of WMN (grid topology and random topology). Ten random topologies were created and average values of chosen QoS parameters were computed.
Figure 5 shows the average values of end-to-end delay for various numbers of radio interfaces and two different network topologies. From results it is obvious that the highest value of end-to-end delay (0.92 sec) was reached in the grid WMN with one radio interface. The lowest value of delay (0.0097 sec) was achieved in grid WMN with seven radio interfaces. In WMN with random topology, the lowest value of delay (0.049 sec) was achieved in WMN with six radio interfaces. The best values of average delay were achieved in WMN with random topology, but differences between values of random and grid topologies were small

for higher number of radio interfaces. From results it may be concluded that optimal number of radio interfaces which guarantee the maximum allowable average delay 150 ms (ITUT, 2003) for both network topologies is five, because more than five interfaces improved value of end-to-end delay only slightly, but the complexity of node is increased considerably.

Figure 6 shows the average values of network throughput for various numbers of radio interfaces and two different network topologies. The lowest value of average throughput was achieved in grid WMN, where nodes have used for transmission only one radio interface. In this case, the value of average throughput was 504.28 kbps. In the case where WMN with random topology and one radio interface was used, the lowest value of average throughput (739.3 kbps) was achieved. The highest value of throughput (2019.9 kbps) reaches the grid WMN with seven radio interfaces. The best value of average throughput in random WMN topology (1964.2 kbps) was achieved by WMN with seven radio interfaces. Again, the optimal number of interfaces for both network topologies was chosen as five.

As we can see from Fig.7, the highest value of packet loss (75.1%) was reached in grid WMN with one radio interface. The lowest value of packet loss was achieved in WMN with seven radio interfaces. This value was 3.5% for the random topology and 2.5% for grid topology. As in the previous case, we can conclude the optimal number of radio interfaces as five, where grid topology achieved 9.8% of packet loss and 7.6% for random topology.
Figure 8 shows the average values of time jitter for different types of topologies and various number of radio interfaces. From results it is obvious that the highest value of average jitter was reached in the network with one radio interface. For the random topology this value was 0.7 sec and for grid topology it was 0.8 sec. On the other hand the lowest values of average jitter were achieved in grid WMN with seven interfaces (0.3 sec) and in random WMN with six interfaces (0.05 sec). As an optimal number of radio interfaces, the number of six was selected with average jitter value 0.11 sec for random topology and 0.14 sec for grid topology.

3.2.2. Different number of data flows
Simulation model consisted of 25 static wireless mesh nodes placed in grid in area 1000x1000 m (Fig.4a). Transmission range for each node was set to 200 m. As traffic transmission, the 5, 10, 15 and 20 CBR flows were simulated and packet size of 512 bytes was used. Data flows were created between random chosen node pairs.
Figure 9 shows the average values of end-to-end delay for different number of data flows. From results it is obvious that the best performance was achieved in multi-interface WMN with six interfaces, when the number of flows changed. The highest value of average end-toend delay (for all data flows) was reached by WMN with one radio interface. For small number of data flows (5), WMN with 5 interfaces reached the best performance, whilst for 10 data flows the best performance was reached by 6 interfaces. For more data flows (15 and 20) the system performance is unsatisfactory regardless of number of interfaces.

Figure 10 shows the simulation results of average values of network throughput for the 5, 10, 15 and 20 data flows. The lowest value of average throughput was achieved in grid WMN with only one radio interface. From results it is obvious that the highest value of average throughput was reached in the multi-interface WMN with six radio interfaces. In the WMN with more than six interfaces the network performance is decreasing.
