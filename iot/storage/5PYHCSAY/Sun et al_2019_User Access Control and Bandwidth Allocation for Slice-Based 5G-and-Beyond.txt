Abstract—In this paper, we investigate the resource management for radio access network slicing from user access control and wireless bandwidth allocation perspectives. First, to guarantee users’ QoS, we propose two admission control (AC) policies to select admissible users from the perspective of optimizing the QoS and the number of serving users respectively. Then, to optimize the bandwidth utilization for the selected admissible users, we investigate the slice association and bandwidth allocation (SABA) problem and propose network centric and UE centric SABA policies respectively. Numerical results show that in typical scenarios, our proposed AC and SABA policies can signiﬁcantly outperform traditional policies in terms of wireless bandwidth utilization and number of admissible users.
I. INTRODUCTION
It is envisioned in 5G-and-beyond systems, networks will be further abstracted into network slicing (NS), which enables design, deployment, customization, and optimization of isolated virtual sub-networks/slices on a common physical network infrastructure [1]–[3]. This NS-based new architecture can dramatically improve network capabilities in terms of capacity, delay, transmission rate, etc. by providing tailored service to meet users’ speciﬁc quality of service (QoS) demands. Recently, some research work starts to focus on NS function virtualization and softwarizaion for core networks and radio access networks (RAN) [4]–[7], where optimization of resource conﬁguration between multiple NSs as well as some NS deployment problems, such as NS structure, cooperation between control and data planes are investigated. In the meanwhile, very little attention is paid to user equipment (UE) access control and wireless resource allocation (ACRA) in radio access network (RAN) slicing. Indeed, ACRA is one of the most important procedures for RAN slicing and thus determines both users and overall system performance [8].
In RAN slicing, the ACRA problem is fundamentally different from that in conventional mobile networks. First, from the network architecture perspective, the NSs are logically virtualized and isolated over shared physical networks. Hence, both physical and virtual resource constraints need to be considered

to form a complete function chain for the speciﬁc service. Second, from the user association perspective, UEs should be associated with an NS via a speciﬁc physical access point (AP) such as base station (BS). Hence, a joint optimization of NS and BS selection should be addressed. Third, from the service perspective, NS-based networks provide guaranteed QoS for all serving UEs instead of the traditional “best effort” model [9]. Due to the aforementioned challenges, applying traditional ACRA mechanisms to RAN slicing may lead to low resource utilization, poor QoS provisioning, frequent NS re-conﬁgurations and etc. Therefore, designing new ACRA mechanisms dedicated for RAN slicing to optimize network performance becomes an essential yet challenging issue.
In this paper, we study user ACRA problem in RAN slicing for 5G-and-beyond mobile communication systems. First, to guarantee the QoS of UEs we investigate user admission control (AC), and propose two AC policies to select admissible users from the perspective of optimizing QoS and the number of users respectively. We then optimize the bandwidth utilization for the selected admissible users by solving the NS association and bandwidth allocation (SABA) problem and propose network centric and UE centric SABA policies respectively. Numerical results show that in typical scenarios, our proposed AC and SABA policies can signiﬁcantly outperform the traditional policies in terms of the number of serving UEs and the bandwidth consumption.
In the rest of the paper, we present system model and problem formulation in Section II and III respectively. In Section IV, admission control policies are proposed to select the admissible users, and then the SABA problem for the admitted users is solved in Section V. We present numerical results in Section VI and conclude this paper in Section VII.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
Consider a multi-slice and multi-AP communication scenario, where the BSs associated with multiple slices are deployed in the area. Each BS supports several NSs with different provisioned QoS, and each NS may also cover several BSs. Multiple UEs are randomly distributed in this area with different QoS requirements. Let B, S and U denote the set of

978-1-5386-8088-9/19/$31.00 ©2019 IEEE

BSs, NSs and UEs, respectively. For a speciﬁc BS, say BS k,
we use Sk to denote the set of NSs supported by BS k.
We identify a speciﬁc NS, say NS j, by transmission rate,
delay, and the resource allocation in core and access networks.
Thus, besides the slice ID, four elements (Rj, Dj, Λj, Bj) are used to identify the j-th slice, where Rj and Dj denotes the
minimum transmission rate and the maximum delay that NS
j can provide to its serving UEs respectively, Λj denotes the
bandwidth allocated to NS j in core network, and Bj is a vector denoting the wireless bandwidth allocation of NS j from all BSs. Let b(jk) be the k-th element of vector Bj denoting the bandwidth of NS j allocated by BS k. b(jk) = 0 when BS k is not in the coverage of NS j.
For a speciﬁc UE, say UE n with qn volume data to
be transmitted, the QoS can be described by two metrics: transmission rate r¯n and delay d¯n [10]. NS j is admissible for UE n when Rj ≥ r¯n and Dj ≤ d¯n. We now study the two QoS metrics respectively. Let rnj,k be the transmission rate of UE n served by NS j via BS k. For simplicity,
we use Shannon theory to deﬁne the transmission rate, i.e., rnj,k = wnj,klog2(1 + SINRkn), where wnj,k is the wireless bandwidth that BS k allocates to the UE n which is served by NS j, and SINRkn is the signal-to-noise-ratio between UE n and BS k. We use djn,k = qn/rnj,k to denote the delay in RAN of UE n served by NS j via BS k. Thus, the end-to-end delay can be approximately calculated as djn,k + Dj.

III. PROBLEM FORMULATION

The optimization problem in this work can be described
as: minimizing the bandwidth consumption subject to QoS,
NS and BS resource constraints through joint access control
and bandwidth allocation for UEs. Before formulating this problem, we deﬁne a binary variable xjn,k ∈ 0, 1, ∀(n, j, k) ∈ U × S × B, where xjn,k = 1 indicates that UE n is served by NS j via BS k. We can formulate the access control and bandwidth allocation problem P1 as:

P1 : min

xjn,k wnj,k ,

n∈U j∈S k∈B

s.t.

xjn,krnj,k ≤ Λj , ∀j ∈ S

(1) (1-1) (1-2) (1-3) (1-4) (1-5) (1-6) (1-7)

where xjn,k and wnj,k are the optimization variables. Constraint (1-1) is referred to as the wired link resource constraint to guarantee that the total transmission rate offered by an NS does not exceed the link budget of that NS. Constraint (1-2) states the wireless bandwidth constraint. It ensures that the total bandwidth allocated to UEs by NS j via BS k does not exceed the wireless bandwidth budget of NS j deployed on BS k. Note that constraint (1-2) also ensures that UEs cannot access an NS via the BS that cannot provide such a service. Constraints (1-3)-(1-5) guarantee the QoS (rate and delay) of UEs can be satisﬁed by its’ serving BS and NS. Constraints (1-6) and (1-7) ensure that each UE can only access one NS via one BS at a time.
Since P1 requires to guarantee the QoS of all the UEs with limited resources, there may be no feasible solution in the case of dense UE distribution and/or high QoS requirement. Therefore, some UEs cannot be served in the resources limited RAN slicing. In the following, we ﬁrst need to conduct admission control to select suitable serving UEs for the network.
IV. ADMISSION CONTROL
In this section, we design admission control (AC) schemes for the network to ﬁnd a set of admissible UEs whose QoS can be satisﬁed simultaneously. We assume that network slice allocates minimal required wireless bandwidth to UEs to satisfy the UEs’ minimum QoS requirements. Thus, the original constraints (1-3)-(1-5) about UEs QoS become equality constraints. Moreover, as we use this assumption, the allocated bandwidth wnj,k is not the optimization variable for AC design. We will optimize wnj,k in the next section by solving P1 for those admissible UEs.
Deﬁnition 1: Subset A is an admissible UE set (AUS) if problem P1 is feasible when U is replaced by A.
Deﬁnition 1 describes the feasibility of a UE subset. Hence, for a speciﬁc AUS, the slice-based network can simultaneously guarantee the QoS of all the UEs in this AUS. However, it is not a sufﬁcient condition to achieve good overall network performance. For example, it is meaningless to choose an AUS which contains only one UE. Therefore, we need to design an approach to ﬁnd a UE subset which is not only feasible for problem P1 but also achieves good overall network performance. In the following of this section, we will develop two AC schemes under Assumption 1 to optimize the QoS and number of admissible UEs respectively.
A. Optimal QoS AC Scheme
In this subsection, we ﬁrst consider AC scheme from UE QoS perspective. Our main idea is to reject the UEs which have QoS gap between the requirement and availability. First, we introduce two elastic variables rˇn and dˇn for UE n to describe the rate and delay degradation respectively. We restrict that 0 ≤ rˇn ≤ r¯n and dˇn ≥ 0. Therefore, the rate and delay requirement of UE n can be referred to as r¯n − rˇn and d¯n + dˇn respectively. The UE n is admissible when rˇn = 0 and dˇn = 0. Our strategy is to reject the UEs with minimal sum of QoS degradation. Thus, we have the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 2: Subset A is a QoS-admissible UE set (QoS-

AUS) if A is an AUS, and with the minimum achievable value

of

n∈U \A

+ rˇn

dˇn

d¯n

.

Here we use the normalized degradation of transmission rate (i.e., rˇn/r¯n) and delay (dˇn/d¯n). This deﬁnition describes both

the feasibility and the QoS performance of a UE subset. In the

following, we design an AC scheme named QoS-AC to ﬁnd the QoS-AUS. By introducing elastic variables rˇn and dˇn, we
formulate problem P2 as follows.

In P2, the optimization objective is minimizing the nor-
malized QoS degradation of all UEs. Compared with the constraints in P1, the only difference is using equalities in
constraints (2-3)-(2-5) to replace the inequalities in (1-3)-(15) by introducing elastic variables. In P2, the optimization variables are binary indicators xjn,k as well as the continuous elastic variables rˇn and dˇn. Hence, P2 is a mixed integer liner programming (MILP). As we introduce the elastic variables
into the above MILP, the QoS of UEs can vary with the elastic variables, and thus problem P2 is always feasible. Using
Lagrange decomposition theory [11], we can obtain the optimal solution of P2 denoted as {rˇ∗, dˇ∗, x∗}.
Then we design QoS-AC policy based on the solution of P2 to ﬁnd the QoS-AUS in Deﬁnition 2. Let rˇn∗ and dˇ∗n be the optimal solution of UE n. If rˇn∗ = 0 and dˇ∗n = 0, it means that there is no QoS degradation of the UE. In other words, this
UE can be admissible for the network. Hence, based on this
observation, we design QoS-AC policy, where the UEs with rˇn∗ = 0 and dˇ∗n = 0 can be accepted by the network, and others are rejected due to limited resources. Hence, the admissible set of UE can be expressed as AQ−A = {n : rˇn∗ = 0, dˇ∗n = 0, n ∈ U }.
We can prove that the QoS-AC policy can minimize the QoS
degradation of the rejected UEs, i.e., it guarantees the QoS
performance and the feasibility. Moreover, this AC policy also

guides network operators to re-allocate bandwidth in the NS reconﬁguration phase thus to satisfy QoS of all the UEs in set U with the minimum bandwidth consumption. However, network slice reconﬁguration is beyond the scope of this work. QoS-AC policy is focused on QoS degradation, and the performance of the number of admissible UEs cannot be guaranteed. In the next subsection, we will design another AC scheme named Num-AC to maximize the number of admissible UEs.

B. Num-AC Scheme
In the proposed QoS-AC, we ﬁnd that some UEs with only rate or delay degradation (i.e. rˇn∗ > 0, dˇ∗n = 0 or dˇ∗n > 0, rˇn∗ = 0) should be rejected. This means that some unviolated constraints are deleted in P1, which implies that the network may have some spare resources to accept more UEs. Hence, from the number of admissible UEs perspective, the performance of QoS-AC policy may not be good. Moreover, the number of admissible UEs is also one of the key performance measures of UE admission control policy. Therefore, we propose Num-AC policy based on the solution of P2 to optimize the number of admissible UEs.
By analyzing the optimal solution of P2, we ﬁnd that the smaller rˇn∗ or dˇ∗n is, the more likely the rate or delay of UE n can be satisﬁed. Based on this observation, we develop NumAC policy to ﬁnd the admissible UE subset with respect to the number of admissible UEs, and we denote by AN −A the corresponding subset. The basic idea of this policy is trying to add the UEs with small rˇn∗ and dˇ∗n into set AN −A.
First of all, the UEs with rˇn∗ = 0 and dˇ∗n = 0 are deﬁnitely admissible for the network. Hence, AQ−A ⊆ AN −A. We then try to ﬁnd more admissible UEs from set U \AQ−A, and add these UEs into AN −A. The details of Num-AC policy are summarized as Algorithm 1.

In the initialization stage, we add the deﬁnite admissible

UEs. Then in the search stage, we check the feasibility of

other UEs one by one. The smaller the value of

is, the more likely the UE is admissible. Hence, we check

UEs with the smallest value of

ﬁrst. To reduce

the computational complexity, once a UE is unfeasible for the

network, we stop the check, and then obtain the set AN −A. Therefore, this policy needs to solve P2 at most |U| times in

the worst case.

V. NETWORK SLICE ASSOCIATION AND BANDWIDTH ALLOCATION POLICY
We now focus on the network slice association and bandwidth allocation (SABA) problem formulated in P1 for the admissible UE subsets. In this section, we develop two NS association and bandwidth allocation policies, i.e., Net-SABA and UE-SABA from network and UE perspective respectively. Net-SABA policy determines NS association and bandwidth allocation for UEs to minimize the overall bandwidth consumption. UE-SABA policy with low computational complexity tries to reduce the individual UE bandwidth consumption from a feasible solution.

A. Network Centric Policy Net-SABA
We ﬁrst develop the network centric SABA policy named Net-SABA. For convenience, we use ynj,k = wnj,k/b(jk) to replace wnj,k, and thus ynj,k ∈ [0, 1]. In addition, we deﬁne a mapping function φ(n, j, k) to determine a unique integer between 1 and |x| when n, j, k is given, where |x| is the number of elements of all xjn,k. Then, we transform variables xjn,k and ynj,k into x˜φ(n,j,k) and y˜φ(n,j,k) , i.e., xjn,k = x˜φ(n,j,k) and ynj,k = y˜φ(n,j,k). Let φ−(n1), φ−(j1) and φ−(k1) be the inverse function of n, j and k, respectively. Let x and y be the set of
x˜φ(n,j,k) and y˜φ(n,j,k) respectively. In the following, we solve P1 with respect to x and y.
Note that it is hard to directly ﬁnd the optimal solution for P1 due to the binarity of x. Here, we ﬁrst relax the feasible region of x and y to a convex set, and then solve P1 subject to
the relaxed convex feasible region. Let Z be the feasible region of P1, and thus Z = {(x, y) : s.t. constraints (1−1)−(1−7)}.
The convex hull of a set Z, denoted by conv (Z) is the smallest
convex set that contains Z [12]. Using the similar idea of [13],
we give conv (Z) in the following.
Deﬁne the polynomial factors of degree d as Fd(J1, J2) = [Πi∈J1 x˜i][Πj∈J2 (1 − x˜j)], where J1, J2 ⊆ {1, 2, , . . . , |x|} ≡ J , J1 ∩ J2 = ∅ and |J1 ∩ J2| = d. To linearize the crossproduct terms of x and y, we deﬁne uJ = Πi∈J x˜i and vJ,m = y˜mΠi∈J x˜i for m = 1, · · ·, |x|, where u∅ = 1 and v∅,m = y˜m, for m = 1, · · ·, |x|. We denote by fd(J1, J2) and fdm(J1, J2) the linearized forms of polynomial expressions Fd(J1, J2) and y˜mFd(J1, J2) respectively. For convenience, let ˜bjn,k ≡ b(jk)log2(1 + SINRkn), and φ ≡ φ(n, j, k).
For constraints (1-1)-(1-3), and (1-5), we then use con-
straints (3)-(6) to relax them, and for constraints (1-4), (1-6),
x˜φ ∈ {0, 1} and y˜φ ∈ [0, 1], we give (7)-(10) to relax them,

x˜φRj − r¯n ≥ 0, ∀n ∈ U

fD2 (J1, J2) ≥ fDm2 (J1, J2) ≥ 0, for m = 1, · · · , |x|, (10) and (J1, J2) of order D2 = min{d + 1, |x|}

By using these relaxed constraints, we obtain a convex relaxation of original feasible region Z. Let Zd = {(x, y, u, v) : s.t. constraints (3) − (10)}. Then the d-degree convex relaxation of Z can be expressed as ZP d = {(x, y) : s.t.(x, y, u, v) ∈ Zd}. Actually, for all degrees 0 ≤ d ≤ |x|, ZP d is a convex relation of the feasible region Z. The larger the degree d is, the tighter the relaxation ZP d is, and the higher computational complexity is needed [13].

Theorem 1: ZP |x| is the convex hull of P1, i.e., ZP |x| = conv (Z )
Proof: By using Theorem 3.5, Extension 1 and Extension 2 of [13], we can easily obtain Theorem 1.
After the relaxation, the feasible region of P1 becomes a convex set with linear constraints. Hence, P1 becomes a linear programming which can be solved easily. Based on the solution of the relaxed P1, we design Net-SABA policy. In Net-SABA policy, we associate UE with the NS and the BS according to x∗, and allocate bandwidth according to y∗, where {x∗, y∗} is the optimal solution to the relaxed problem. Net-SABA policy requires global network information (the association and bandwidth allocation of all UEs) and high computational complexity. In the following, we will design a UE centric SABA policy to reduce individual UE bandwidth consumption with low computational complexity.

B. UE Centric Policy UE-SABA
In this subsection, we develop an efﬁcient UE-SABA policy
to reduce individual UE bandwidth consumption. UE-SABA
policy has two steps, obtaining initial solution and searching better solution. In the ﬁrst step, let x(0) and w(0) be the optimal solution obtained by Num-AC scheme. Hence, x(0) and w(0) is also the feasible solution to P1. We use x(0) and w(0) as
the initial solution. Then in the second step, we try to ﬁnd a better solution for
each UE with the ﬁxed associations of other UEs. In details, let x(s) and w(s) respectively be the NS association and the corresponding bandwidth allocation after s searching steps. In the (s + 1)-th searching step, for a speciﬁc UE n ∈ AN−A, we ﬁrst ﬁx the associations and bandwidth allocations of other UEs, i.e., x(s+1) = x(s) and w(s+1) = w(s) except for the n-th element. Then we optimize the n-th element xjn,k(s + 1) and wnj,k(s + 1). We ﬁnd the set Hn = {(xjn,k, wnj,k) : s.t. constraints (1 − 3) − (1 − 5), and wnj,k ≤ wnj,k(s) − }, where wnj,k(s) is the bandwidth allocation of UE n at the sth step, and is an any positive parameter. If Hn = ∅, we

obtain xjn,k(s + 1) = xjn,k(s) and wnj,k(s + 1) = wnj,k(s). If Hn = ∅, we ﬁnd the pair xjn,k(s + 1), wnj,k(s + 1) in Hn that satisﬁes 1) P1 is feasible respect to x(s+1) and w(s+1), and 2) wnj,k(s+1) is the smallest one among all the pairs which satisfy condition 1). If all the pairs in Hn are infeasible for P1, we have xjn,k(s + 1) = xjn,k(s) and wnj,k(s + 1) = wnj,k(s). In this way, we obtain xjn,k(s+1) and wnj,k(s+1), and thus x(s+1) and w(s+1). Therefore, the (s+1)-th searching step is ﬁnished. The searching termination criteria is set as the association and bandwidth allocation of all the UEs are unchanged.
VI. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed two AC policies (QoS-AC and Num-AC) as well as two SABA policies (Net-SABA and UE-SABA). We compare them with two traditional mechanisms: (1) NS prior association (NSA) and (2) BS prior association (BSA). In detail, for a speciﬁc UE, NSA mechanism ﬁrst ﬁnds the NS that satisﬁes the QoS requirement of the UE, and then ﬁnds the BS covered by this NS with sufﬁcient bandwidth. BSA mechanism ﬁrst ﬁnds the BS with the maximum SINR for the UE, and then ﬁnds the NS deployed in this BS with satisﬁed QoS guarantee. In both NSA and BSA mechanisms, if such a pair of NS and BS is found, the UE is admissible and associated with the NS and BS. The bandwidth allocation policy for NSA and BSA is to allocate the minimal required bandwidth to UEs to satisfy the QoS requirement. Hence, NSA and BSA mechanisms contain both AC and SABA policies.
We consider a network which consists of a macro BS (MBS) located at the central of a circular area with a radius of 500m and varying number of pico BSs (PBS), femto BSs (FBS), NSs and UEs. The transmit power of MBS, PBS and FBS is set to 46dBm, 30dBm and 20dBm, respectively. We use L(d) = 34+40log(d) and L(d) = 37+30log(d) to model the pass loss for the MBS/PBSs and FBSs respectively [14]. All the BSs share 20MHz bandwidth. Each NS randomly covers 4 BSs, and provides different rate and delay performance. UEs are randomly distributed in this area with different rate and delay

requirements. In the following, we examine the performance of proposed AC and SABA policies respectively.
In the ﬁrst experiment, we compare the number of admissible UEs of the four AC policies QoS-AC, Num-AC, NSA and BSA. In this experiment, we ﬁx the number of NSs and BSs to 20 and 21 (including one MBS) respectively. Fig. 1 shows the number of admissible UEs for the four AC policies with different UE distributions. From this ﬁgure, we can see that the number of admissible UEs of QoS-AC and Num-AC are always higher than that of the other two traditional policies which do not consider the characteristics of NS-based RAN. Speciﬁcally, when the number of UEs is 200, the admissible number of UEs for Num-AC, QoS-AC, BSA and NSA is 173, 142, 118 and 92, respectively. These results show that the proposed Num-AC policy can serve 47% and 88% more UEs when compared with NSA and BSA.
Fig. 1. The number of admissible UEs for the four AC policies.
In the second experiment, we compare the bandwidth consumption of the four SABA policies (Net-SABA, UE-SABA, NSA and BSA) with the same parameters as the ﬁrst experiment. Fig. 2 shows the bandwidth consumption for the four policies as a function of number of UEs. From Fig. 2,

Fig. 2. Relationship between bandwidth consumption the number of UEs.
we can see that the bandwidth consumption of the traditional policy BSA is always the smallest. This is because that UEs always access the BS with the maximum SINR value in BSA policy. However, from the ﬁrst experiment, we can see that the number of admissible UEs is much smaller than that of the two proposed policies. Moreover, we ﬁnd that the difference of bandwidth consumption between Net-SABA and BSA is relatively small (for example, 7% for 150 UEs), implying that much more UEs can be served with a small compromise on bandwidth consumption.
Fig. 3. Relationship between bandwidth consumption the number of NSs.
Next, we examine the bandwidth consumption of the four SABA policies for varying number of NSs while using ﬁxed number of UEs 200. Fig. 3 shows the bandwidth consumption for the four policies with different number of NSs. We can see that the bandwidth consumption of all four policies monotonically increases with the number of NSs. The more NSs deployed, the better association choice for UEs, and thus the less bandwidth consumption. When the number of NSs equals 40, all the four policies can achieve low bandwidth consumption due to the sufﬁcient available NSs. Similar to that in the second experiment, the average UE bandwidth

consumption of Net-SABA is the lowest, although the total
bandwidth consumption of Net-SABA is slightly higher than
that of BSA.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have investigated the user access control
and bandwidth allocation in radio access network slicing for
5G-and-beyond systems. From the QoS and the number of
users perspectives respectively, we have proposed two user
admission control policies to select the admissible users. Then,
we have studied the NS association and bandwidth allocation
problem for those admissible users. We have proposed two
policies Net-SABA and UE-SABA from network and UE per-
spective. Numerical results show that in typical scenarios, our
proposed AC and SABA policies can signiﬁcantly outperform
the traditional policies in terms of the number of admissible
UEs and bandwidth consumption.
