Focus on any technique helping to get efficient and accurate results

Even advanced methods cannot deal with complex instances of real problems: high dimension, constrains, epistasis, uncertain data, real time, …

Traditional methods put so many constrains and simplifications to the problem (in order to solve it) that the found solution is no longer valid

Smart semaphores control: approach

A software tool for the control center, using a bio-inspired engine, to assist the experts on the semaphore scheduling, for a given urban area or the whole city
By means of simulation and other software facilities used in the Traffic Control Center of the city, we can generate optimized traffic schedules and efficient strategies of smart mobility for semaphores
Optimized schedules can then be later applied to real traffic management, after verification tests with such a simulated program (off-line plus on-line)

- VANET communications imply: highly dynamic topology, limitations in coverage, bandwidth, and energy consumption, network congestion, frequent disconnections, and others…
- An optimal configuration of the communication protocols can improve the quality-of-service (QoS) of the network: a must in this domain
- Using intelligent automatic techniques to face the huge number of possible protocol configurations

Smart bus scheduling (II)

2016 Networking and

The scheduling generated by the proposed application is flexible and it also allows to small changes (few minutes) in the departures of the buses to adjust their scheduling to the current situation. For example:
- Quite a number of passengers (mainly students) of lines 20 and 22 do a transfer to line 5. The scheduling of line 5 can be online tuned (only a few minutes) if a delay is detected in lines 20 or 22

A small delay in line 20 will ask for a small delay in the departure of buses in line 5 and help bus transit

Summary

2016 Networking and

Smart cities need efficient and effective modern problem solvers We can use existing information and procedures to improve them (a must!) We can build small/large, context-aware and adaptive applications Here, solutions are both vertical (specialized) and horizontal (integral) We must face multiple levels at smart cities: citizens, districts, city, routes, infrastructure, city council, public/private companies… We can exploit open/big data to build unseen new services Incorporating a business model is mandatory: so how to make research? An amazing domain for new ideas and collaborations !!!
