Abstract—To satisfy diverse use cases and business models in ﬁfth generation (5G) wireless communication, network slicing in fog radio access networks (F-RANs) is proposed, which provides a cost efﬁcient networking in a convenient way. However, the resource management for network slices is challenging, especially when the edge caching is utilized to alleviate the fronthaul burden and reduce the delay. In this paper, we investigate the joint sub-carrier allocation and caching placement for two network slices, and an average delay optimization problem for one slice with user data rate guarantee for the other slice is formulated, which can be solved by a two-step iterative algorithm. The core idea is to optimize decoupled variables iteratively via Hungarian method, linear integer programming, and geometric programming(GP) with the help of decomposition. Simulation results reveal a fast convergence speed and a near-optimal performance of the proposed algorithm.

I. INTRODUCTION
Driven by the emergence of a variety of new use cases and business models, the network slicing technique is proposed to improve network ﬂexibility and reduce operating costs. Through splitting the physical network into several virtual networks as network slices, each slice is customized to provide only functions and resources that is necessary for a speciﬁc application. Meanwhile, the F-RAN is regarded as a potential network architecture for high throughput, high energy efﬁciency, high reliability, and low latency [1], and hence network slicing in F-RANs is attractive.
To harvest the potential advantages of network slicing, the effective resource management for network slices has been studied [2]. In [3], the author developed a joint base station assignment, sub-carrier, and power allocation algorithm to maximize the network sum rate in multi-cell virtualized wireless networks under satisfying the minimum rate constraint of each slice. In [4], the massive multi-input-multi-output technology is introduced to enlarge spatial degree of freedom and enhance the sum-utility of all network slices by optimizing the antennas allocation together with power and sub-carrier allocation. To achieve the fairness among network slices, a criterion based on a weighted proportionally fair object for dynamic resource allocation is proposed in [5]. In addition to the centralized resource management, some researches based on the hierarchical architecture are conducted as well. A

two-level hierarchical resource allocation problem is modeled as an auction game in [6], where the network operator is responsible for resource management among network slices, and each slice allocates the resources to its own users.
Generally, majority of previous works focus only on the radio resource allocation for network slicing. In order to make the network slices work in a more optimized way and provide higher quality-of-service, the edge caching in the radio access network can be fully utilized to alleviate the fronthaul burden and reduce the delay. Due to the strong relationship between radio resource allocation and caching placement, how to design the caching strategy is regarded as a novel important consideration for resource management, which has been seldom studied in the literatures. In this paper, a dynamic resource allocation optimization problem that jointly considers the sub-carrier allocation, user association and caching placement is formulated in F-RANs to minimize average delay for one slice and meanwhile guarantee the user data rate of the other slice. To handle the non-convexity of the problem, a two-step iterative algorithm based on relaxation and convexiﬁcation is developed, which can approach the optimal solution with lower complexity compared with the exhaustive search.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the system model and problem formulation are presented. Section III introduces the proposed two-step iterative algorithm. Section IV demonstrates the simulation results and detailed analysis, followed by the conclusion in Section V.
II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION
A. Scenario Description
As illustrated in Fig. 1, the downlink transmission in FRAN is considered, in which two typical types of network slices coexist. One is eMBB slice which is deﬁned to provide enhanced mobile broadband services, and the other is URLLC slice which is responsible for ultra-reliable and low latency communications. Due to different performance requirements of two slices, the F-RAN conﬁgures customized communication modes for them by mode selection. The eMBB slice is equipped with M single-antenna remote radio heads (RRHs), and all RRHs serve users together with the cooperative communication. The URLLC slice is consisted of N single-antenna fog access points (F-APs), which are

equipped with distributed caching, and each F-AP serves part of users independently. Let M = {1, 2, . . . , M } and N = {1, 2, . . . , N } denote the set of RRHs and F-APs, respectively. All RRHs and F-APs are connected to a base
band unit (BBU) pool with high-capacity fronthaul links. A total of Q single-antenna user equipments (UEs) request to access to the network, among them, K UEs access to eMBB slice and the rest U UEs connect with URLLC slice. Let K = {1, 2, . . . , K} and U = {K + 1, K + 2, . . . , K + U } denote the set of UEs in two slices, i.e., Q = K + U , and the set of all UEs is Q = {1, 2, . . . , Q}. The system bandwidth of W Hz is divided into S sub-carriers and shared by all UEs through orthogonal frequency division multiple access
(OFDMA). To ensure each UE can be assigned with at least one sub-carrier, let S = {1, 2, . . . , S} denote the set of subcarriers, i.e., S ≥ Q and the bandwidth of each sub-carrier is W1 = W/S. Let hi,s,k, gj,s,u represent the channel state information on the sub-carrier s from the RRH i to UE k and the F-AP j to UE u, respectively. Each RRH i and F-AP j transmit at a ﬁxed power pRi and pFj , respectively, and the additive white Gaussian noise is denoted with the distribution CN (0, σ2).

B. System Model
Due to OFDMA, each sub-carrier cannot be allocated to more than one UE. Let αs,q ∈ {0, 1} be a binary variable, which represents whether the sub-carrier s is allocated to UE q or not. i.e., αs,q = 1 implies the sub-carrier s is allocated to UE q, and αs,q = 0 otherwise. Thus, the subcarrier allocation strategy (SCAS) can be deﬁned as follow

α = {αs,q : s ∈ S, q ∈ Q} ∈ CS×Q

(1)

The library of F ﬁles, denoted by F = {1, 2, . . . , F },
is stored in the BBU pool. The size of the f -th ﬁle is Cf bits and the capacity of j-th F-APs is limited with Oj bits, therefore, each F-AP can only cache part of ﬁles. Let binaryvalued βf,j ∈ {0, 1} represent caching placement indicator, i.e., βf,j = 1 indicates the ﬁle f is cached in F-AP j, and

βf,j = 0 otherwise. The caching placement strategy (CPS) can be given as

β = {βf,j : f ∈ F , j ∈ N } ∈ CF ×N

(2)

Meanwhile, the ﬁle preferences of UE u requesting for ﬁle

f can be deﬁned as the request probability Pu,f , which are

normalized as

F f =1

Pu,f

=

1.

Considering the different communication modes and per-

formance requirements between network slices, two system

models are established, respectively.

1) eMBB Slice In order to provide a higher transmission rate, all RRHs
cooperatively transmit the signal to UEs based on the global cloud radio access network mode [7]. Therefore, the total rate of UE k can be expressed as

Rk = αs,kRs,k

s∈S

|hi,s,k (t)|2 pRi

=

αs,kW1log2(1 + i∈M σ2

) (3)

s∈S

where Rs,k is the available rate of UE k on sub-carrier s. The performance To ensure basic rate requirements of UEs
in eMBB slice, each UE k requests for a minimum reserved rate of Rkthr.

2) URLLC Slice
In order to shorten the user-perceived delay for delaysensitive applications, the local F-AP mode [7] is adopted to provide services. Since each UE only can be served by one F-AP and the maximum number of the F-AP j for accessing is limited as Aj, the problem of user association needs to be additional considered to improve network performances. Let xj,u ∈ {0, 1} be a binary variable indicating whether or not UE u is associated with F-AP j, i.e., xj,u = 1 indicates the UE u is associated with F-AP j, and xj,u = 0 otherwise. The association between UEs and F-APs can be described as the following matrix,

x = {xj,u : j ∈ N , u ∈ U } ∈ CN×U

(4)

When UEs request ﬁles from the associated F-APs, the main components of delay are the wireless transmission delay and the fronthaul delay. The transmission delay for transmitting ﬁle f from F-AP j to UE u is calculated as

DjT,u,f

Cf Rj,u

is related to the average link distance and trafﬁc load. For

simpliﬁcation, we assume the fronthaul delay as a ﬁxed value

DF , which is larger than the transmission delay. The actual

2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)

delay will not contain the fronthaul delay if the requested ﬁle is cached in the associated F-AP. However, if the ﬁle is not cached, the F-AP needs to fetch the ﬁle from the BBU pool through fronthaul links ﬁrst, which produces the fronthaul delay. Thus, the fronthaul delay between UE u and F-AP j for ﬁle f can be calculated as

DjF,u,f = (1 − βf,j )DF

(6)

Consequently, the delay for UE u which is associated with F-AP j requesting for ﬁle f can be written as

Dj,u,f = DjT,u,f + DjF,u,f

=

Cf Rj,u

+ (1 − βf,j )DF

C. Problem Formulation

To optimize the whole system performance while sat-

isfying the fundamental performance of each slice as the

prerequisite, the resource allocation and caching placement

should be jointly considered owing to the mutual inﬂuence

on the ultimate performance. In order to deal with two

different performance metrics together, a common method is

to combine two metrics into a uniﬁed optimization objective,

such as spectral efﬁciency. However, in the current situation,

the ratio of rate to delay has not been deﬁned yet, which

makes the combination meaningless. Therefore, in this paper,

we adopt to individually optimize the performance of URLLC

slice, which guaranteeing the rate requirement of eMBB slice.

With the consideration of carrier reuse constraint, accessing

capability constraint and caching capacity constraint, the joint

resource allocation, user association and caching placement

problem to minimize the average delay of UEs in URLLC

slice is formulated as

min D¯
{x,α,β}

s.t. C1 : αs,q ≤ 1, ∀s ∈ S

C2 : βf,jCf ≤ Oj, ∀j ∈ N
f ∈F

C3 : xj,u = 1, ∀u ∈ U
j∈N

C4 : xj,u ≤ Aj, ∀j ∈ N
u∈U
C5 : Rk ≥ Rkthr, ∀k ∈ K
where the optimization objective D¯ is the average delay of all UEs requesting any ﬁles in URLLC slice. C1 is the subcarrier constraint which ensures each sub-carrier cannot be allocated to more than one UE at the same time. C2 denotes the ﬁle caching constraint of each F-AP. C3 and C4 indicate the association constraint of users and F-APs, respectively. C5 is the performance constraint of each UE in eMBB slice.
Note that the optimization problem (8) is a non-linear combination optimization problem, which can be proved as

a NP-hard problem [8], and it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd the globally optimal solution. Therefore, proposing an efﬁcient algorithm with reasonable computational complexity is desirable.

III. TWO-STEP ITERATIVE ALGORITHM
To tackle the computational complexity of (8), an effective iterative algorithm to optimize the sub-carrier allocation, user association and caching placement for network slices is proposed in this section. The optimization variables are tightly coupled in the objective function, which causes the problem hard to solve directly. Therefore, variable decoupling is applied to reduce the complexity. Firstly, the original problem is decomposed into two sub-problems with independent variables. When each sub-problem is optimized for the optimal variable value, the remaining variables are assumed to be given. Based on the loop iteration, all variables will tend to be stable, and these values can be approximated as optimal solutions to the problem.

A. Joint User Association and Caching Placement Problem
Based on a given SCAS, the transmission delay DjT,u,f can be regarded as a ﬁxed value. However, the user association variable and caching placement variable are still coupled in the optimization problem. To conquer this challenge, a new variable zju,f = xj,u(1 − βf,j) is introduced and the optimization problem can be rewritten as

min
{x,β,z}

1 U

Pu,f (xj,uDjT,u,f + zj,u,f DF )

u∈U f ∈F j∈N

(9)

s.t. C2, C3, C4

C6 : zju,f = xj,u(1 − βf,j )

To deal with the problem (9) with non-convex constraint C6, the McCormick convex relaxation is applied to equivalently transform the equality constraint C6 to a series of inequality constraints by using McCormick envelopes [9], which is given by

zju,f ≥ xj,u − βf,j, ∀j ∈ N , ∀u ∈ U , ∀f ∈ F (10)

zju,f ≤ xj,u, ∀j ∈ N , ∀u ∈ U , ∀f ∈ F

(11)

zju,f ≤ 1 − βf,j, ∀j ∈ N , ∀u ∈ U , ∀f ∈ F

(12)

0 ≤ zju,f ≤ 1, ∀j ∈ N , ∀u ∈ U , ∀f ∈ F

(13)

In order to solve the new optimization problem, we use the Lagrange partial relaxation to relax the constraints (10)-(12), and deﬁne the respective set of dual Lagrange multipliers as

ϕuj,f ≥ 0, ∀j ∈ N , ∀u ∈ U , ∀f ∈ F

(14)

ηju,f ≥ 0, ∀j ∈ N , ∀u ∈ U , ∀f ∈ F

(15)

χuj,f ≥ 0, ∀j ∈ N , ∀u ∈ U , ∀f ∈ F

(16)

Hence, the Lagrange function is expressed as

L(ϕ, η, χ, x, β, z)

(17)

best user association and CPS. The concrete implementation algorithm of this process is summarized in Algorithm 1. Step A.
B. Sub-carrier Allocation Problem
With the derived user association and CPS, the optimization problem (8) can be simpliﬁed to only solve the subcarrier allocation problem with single variable. Thus, the optimization problem is rewritten as

where f (x), f (β) and f (z) are the polynomial functions with corresponding variables. Thus, the dual problem can be reformulated as

help of successive convex approximation (SCA) [12]. The

Particulary, after the decomposition, the joint optimization problem becomes essentially separate optimization problems. The sub-problem P1 is a typical assignment problem, which can be solved by Hungarian method. And both sub-problem P2 and P3 are the liner integer optimization problems, which can be solved by the generic linear integer programming method.

arithmetic-geometric mean approximation (AGMA) can be applied as the method of SCA to transform the posynomial function into the monomial form.
With the help of AGMA, the posynomial denominator of (26) can be approximated as the product of monomial functions. In iteration t2, the rate Rj,u = αs,uRj,s,u can
s∈S
be approximated as

By solving the sub-problems and obtaining the values of x, β, z, the sub-gradient method is used to update the dual variables. In the iteration t1, the dual variables are updated

Rj,u(t2) =
s∈S

αs,u(t2)Rj,s,u τj,s,u(t2)

τj,s,u (t2 )

(28)

as follow:

ϕuj,f (t1 + 1) = [ϕuj,f (t1) + δ(t1)d(ϕuj,f (t1))]+

(20)

ηju,f (t1 + 1) = [ηju,f (t1) + δ(t1)d(ηju,f (t1))]+

(21)

χuj,f (t1 + 1) = [χuj,f (t1) + δ(t1)d(χuj,f (t1))]+

(22)

where [x]+ = max{0, x} and δ(t1) is the step size. And d(ϕuj,f (t1)), d(ηju,f (t1)), d(χuj,f (t1)) are the sub-gradients of
dual problems, which is expressed as

d(ϕuj,f (t1)) = xj,u − βf,j − zj,f

(23)

d(ηju,f (t1)) = zju,f − xj,u

(24)

d(χuj,f (t1)) = zju,f + βf,j − 1

(25)

where τj,s,u(t2) is expressed as

τj,s,u(t2) =

αs,u(t2 − 1)Rj,s,u αs,u(t2 − 1)Rj,s,u

s∈S

(29)

Therefore, the sub-carrier association problem (26) at each iteration t2 can be transformed into the following standard GP problem,

min

Hj,u,f Rj,u(t2)−1

{α} u∈U f ∈F j∈N

s.t. C1

(30)

The problem (30) can be solved by available software

Based on the proof in [10], the problem (9) is guaranteed packages, e.g., CVX. The algorithm for solving this sub-

to converge to optimal values, which can be considered as the problem is described in Algorithm 1. Step B.

2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)

In order to solve the optimization problem, the two-step iterative algorithm is executed to alternately optimize, which will not stop until the differences between solutions in each iteration are smaller than the threshold. That can guarantee the convergence of the proposed Algorithm 1.

Set α(t) = α(t2). 15: Until: |q(t)−q(t−1)| ≤ ε1 and α(t)−α(t−1) ≤ ε2.

C. The Complexity of the Proposed Algorithm

In Step A, to guarantee the accuracy ε1 of sub-gradient method, this process needs O(1/ε12) iterations, and the time complexity in each iteration is O(U 3), where U denotes

the number of users. Therefore, the complexity of the Step

A is O(U 3/ε12). In Step B, since CVX is used to solve

GP problem with the interior point method, the number of

required

iteration

is

O(

log(c/(t0 ε2 log(ξ)

))

),

where

c

is

the

total

number of constraints in (30), t0 is the initial point to

approximate the accuracy of interior point method, ε2 is the stopping criterion and ξ is used for updating the accuracy

of interior point method. The time complexity of Step B

required to convert the non-convex problem to (30) using

AGMA is O(UFNS’+US’). Therefore, the complexity of the

Step

B

is

O((UFNS’+US’)×(

log(c/(t0 ε2 log(ξ)

))

)).

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

A small-scale F-RAN system with two slices is considered during simulations. There are 5 RRHs and 5 UEs in eMBB slice, and 3 F-APs and 6 UEs in URLLC slice, respectively. The number of sub-carriers is S = 20 and the bandwidth of each sub-carrier is W1 = 15KHz. There are a total of 10 ﬁles and the size of each ﬁle is 1 Kbits. Each F-AP can cache 2 ﬁles and allow 3 UEs to access in. The transmission

powers are set by pRi = 8W and pFj = 10W, respectively. The fronthaul delay is 0.5s. The reserved rate of UEs is assumed
as 8 bps/Hz.

Fig. 2. The effect of caching capacity on the system performance.

Due to the caching capability of F-APs, UEs can get cached ﬁles directly from associated F-AP without the fronthaul delay. Fig. 2 approves that the average delay will reduce as the caching capacity of F-APs enhances. However, when the total of ﬁles is much larger than the capacity, the trend of decrease is not obvious. Fig. 3 shows that the abundant sub-carries is beneﬁcial to the delay performance, too. With the increase of the available sub-carriers, the average delay decreases gradually. To provide higher reserved rate for UEs in eMBB slice, the network will allocate more sub-carriers to these UEs in priority which damages the performances of URLLC slice. The distribution of the ﬁle request probability and fronthaul delay also have effect on the average delay. Fig. 4 reveals that the performance bring by Zipf distribution is better than that bring by random distribution. As the Zipf parameter increases, the average delay decreases. Meanwhile, with the increase of fronthaul delay, the average delay will increase accordingly.

V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we jointly consider resource allocation and caching placement for two network slices in the F-RAN. An average delay optimization problem considering user data guarantee is formulated, which is non-convex and NPhard. In order to reduce the complexity, the distributed twostep iterative algorithm is proposed by decomposing the original problem into several sub-problems with different variables, which are solved by Hungarian method, linear programming and GP, respectively. Simulation results reveal that the proposal converges with a fast speed and achieves a

near-optimal performance. Therefore, it can be concluded that our work gives a promising method to jointly determine the optimal resource allocation and caching placement strategy.
