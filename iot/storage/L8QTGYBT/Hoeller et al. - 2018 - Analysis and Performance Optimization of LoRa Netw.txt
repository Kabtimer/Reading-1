Analysis and Performance Optimization of LORA Networks with Time and Antenna Diversity
Arliones Hoeller Jr., Richard Demo Souza, Onel L. Alcaraz Lo´pez, Hirley Alves, Mario de Noronha Neto, and Glauber Brante

Abstract—Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies are increasingly catching the attention of the Internet-ofThings (IoT) market and have brought the need for reliable knowledge about the performance of such networks. This paper is concerned with the performance and scalability of LORA networks, a leading LPWAN technology. Several recently published articles have analyzed the ability of LORA networks to scale, i.e., their ability to support increased trafﬁc and number of nodes. This work proposes to employ message replication and gateways with multiple receive antennas to achieve, respectively, time and spatial diversity. The paper presents the proposed schemes and evaluates them through theoretical analysis and computer simulations. Results show that LORA networks are highly sensitive to the increase in user and trafﬁc density, but both message replication and multiple antennas can enhance performance. Message replication has an optimum number of message copies for each network conﬁguration, and its utilization is more beneﬁcial in low-density networks, while the use of multiple receive antennas at the gateway is always beneﬁcial.
Keywords—Internet-of-Things, Long-Range Low-Power Communications, LoRa, Communication Diversity.
I. INTRODUCTION
The recent years saw the proliferation of the Internetof-Things (IoT) pushed by inexpensive, Internet-connected devices using off-the-shelf components. The growth in the number of connected devices, however, turned the spotlight towards the limits of current connectivity technologies like WiFi, Bluetooth, and ZigBee, in terms not only of cost and size but also network capacity, communication range, and energy consumption [1]. Within this context, the Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies emerged to serve the market of Massive IoT (mIoT) [2], i.e., non-critical, low-power and low-cost applications tolerant to small data-rates and high latency. Among the most prominent LPWAN technologies in the market, today, are LORAWAN, SIGFOX, and RPMA [3].

Although LPWAN technologies are in fast-paced adoption, reports on deployments with large numbers of stations are yet to come out, making their performance and capacity models still an open problem. As a result, recent studies have explored the capacity limits of the technologies and proposed techniques to enhance their performance.
This paper focuses on the aspects of the uplink of the LORA (Long-Range) technology - the underlying proprietary physical layer (PHY) layer of LORAWAN networks [4]. The problem under investigation is that of increasing the coverage probability in LORA networks using time and antenna diversity [5]. More speciﬁcally, this paper analyzes the impact that message replication and gateways with multiple receive antennas have on the outage probability. We accomplished that by extending the outage models previously published by Georgiou and Raza [6] to account for the proposed diversity techniques. Additionally, simulations are used to validate the theoretical modeling, and the analysis of the results yields the formulation of an optimization problem that ﬁnds the optimum number of message replications for a set of network conﬁguration parameters and different network density (number of nodes and their duty cycles).
A. Related Work
Several recent related works have sought to evaluate the performance of LORA networks using analytic modeling [6]– [10] and real measurements [11]–[19]. Additionally, a few techniques have been proposed to enhance the performance of LPWANs in general, with potential modiﬁcations to the current technologies, as for LORA in [20]–[23], UNB/SIGFOX in [24], and for others in [25], [26].
Analytic models have been proposed for a variety of scenarios and communication phenomena. Bor et al. [7] experimentally observed the capture effect of LORA and modeled the capacity of such networks, concluding that LORA networks with only one gateway and conservative operational parameters do not scale well, while networks with dynamic adaptation of operating parameters or multiple gateways tend to scale better. Georgiou and Raza [6] propose an analytic model that takes into account Rayleigh fading and allows to equate the coverage probabilities of nodes in a network considering two outage probabilities: disconnection and collision. Their work shows that LORA networks are sensitive to network density. Gupta et al. [8] modeled the IoT trafﬁc considering periodic messages and event-generated messages and analyzed the impact of trafﬁc variations in LORAWAN networks. They were able to identify that LORA gateways do not handle well burst

events, which generate a signiﬁcant amount of messages in a short period, especially when there is a spatial or temporal correlation in the transmission behavior of IoT devices. Pop et al. [9] evaluated how LORAWAN downlink impacts LORA uplink goodput and coverage probability. They considered the medium access control (MAC) layer and, through simulations, veriﬁed that if too many end-devices request delivery conﬁrmation, the downlink becomes unstable and unable to deliver several acknowledgment packets, thus forcing network nodes to retry their transmissions, ultimately ﬂooding the network. Bankov et al. [10] proposed a mathematical model for LORAWAN channel access taking into account the capture effect and using the Okumura-Hata model, but without fading. Concerning the modeling of communication fading, only Georgiou and Raza [6] and Pop et al. [9] take this impairment into account, to the best of our knowledge.
Several works have used measurements to evaluate the performance of LORA networks. Peta¨ja¨ja¨rvi et al. [11], [12] analyze Doppler robustness, scalability, and coverage of LORA networks and report the experimental validation of such metrics in terrestrial and water environments for static and mobile nodes. Considering a delivery ratio of at least 60% and LORA most conservative conﬁgurations, they were able to communicate to static nodes ranging up to 30 km over the water and up to 10 km on the ground. Regarding Doppler robustness, they observed that communication degrades signiﬁcantly when the velocity of the node in relation to the gateway is above 40 km/h. There are similar reports of LoRa measurements done in different environments, including a university campus [13], indoor applications [14], industry [15], dense cities downtown [16], [17], smart metering [18], and rural areas [19]. Albeit these measurements show interesting results, it is important to note that none of them used a large number of network nodes, thus making it difﬁcult to validate models for dense networks.
A few recently published work also propose some enhancements to LORA. Cuomo et al. [20] propose algorithms to replace LORAWAN adaptive data rate strategy. The proposed algorithms do not base the conﬁguration of the spreading factor (SF) on distance and received power measurements, but take into account the number of connected devices, allowing the equalization of the time-on-air (ToA) of the packets in each SF. Bor and Roedig [21] explore LORA conﬁguration parameters such as SF, bandwidth, coding rate and transmission power, which result in 6, 720 possible settings, and proposes an optimization problem that minimizes energy spent on data transmission while meeting required communication performance. Qin and McCann [22] approach the optimization of LPWANs efﬁciency from a resource allocation perspective. They use game theory to derive an algorithm that allows network nodes to decide which channel and SF to use and, for each channel/SF group, which is the optimal transmit power that maximizes data extraction rate. Voigt et al. [23] consider the inter-network interference that is likely to take place when several independent LORA networks get deployed too close. Authors consider using directional antennas in network nodes and using multiple gateways in the network. Results show that directional antennas enhance data extraction rate, although the

use of multiple gateways in the covered area tends to perform better.
Besides the above works, some authors have explored techniques similar to those proposed in this paper for LORA, UNB/SIGFOX, or for LPWANs in general. Mo et al. [24] investigated the optimal number of message replications for use in UNB/SIGFOX networks. Song et al. [25] consider the macro reception diversity of long-range ALOHA networks, where augmented spatial diversity arises from allowing several base stations to receive the same packet. Magrin et al. [26] developed a simulation model for the NS-3 network simulator with which they showed that LORA networks support a large number of nodes and maintain reasonable network quality if several gateways are carefully placed.
In this paper, we model and validate the behavior of LORA networks using message replication to exploit time diversity and using a single gateway with multiple receive antennas to exploit spatial diversity, striving to maximize network performance. To do that, we take the work of [6] as baseline model and extend it to incorporate the proposed techniques. Our work on message replication differs from [24] because that work considers UNB networks where each transmission uses a random central frequency – an assumption that changes the collision model. Moreover, our work takes fading into account, what [24] does not. Our approach using multiple receive antennas differs from [25] and [26] because they consider spatial diversity generated by multiple gateways. Our work examines the case where multiple receive antennas in a single gateway create signal diversity able to enhance signal quality, an approach that can be naturally extended to the case of multiple gateways in the future. To the best of our knowledge, no work has investigated the use of multiple receive antennas and message replications in LORA networks.
B. Contributions
The contributions of this work can be summarized as:
• The optimization of the number of message copies for each SF conﬁguration that maximizes network coverage probability in LORA networks;
• The formulation of a tight closed-form bound for the collision probability considering gateways with multiple receive antennas;
• The analysis of the interaction between message replication and multiple receive antennas in LORA networks, showing that message replication brings beneﬁts only for low-density networks, while multiple receive antennas are always beneﬁcial.

II. LPWANS AND LORA
LPWANs employ low-power communication technologies that enable the connection of thousands of IoT devices across long distances. Most of these technologies work in frequencies below 1 GHz and employ modulation techniques that enable link budgets of 150±10 dB, resulting in robust communication channels with low energy consumption reaching distances in the order of kilometers [27], [28]. Additionally, for reducing complexity and energy consumption, LPWAN technologies use MAC protocols, which may decrease the efﬁciency of channel use. For instance, both LORAWAN and SIGFOX transmit data using unslotted ALOHA, therefore without previously checking if the channel is in use. ALOHA networks are known to present high collision probability when a large number of stations are connected [29].
A. LORA
LORA is a proprietary sub-GHz chirp spread spectrum modulation technique optimized for long-range applications and low power consumption at a low transmission rate [4], which enables the LPWAN paradigm. The technology allows the use of variable transmission rates with constant bandwidth using different orthogonal SFs. The variable data rate characteristic allows optimizing applications according to range, robustness or energy consumption. With the use of different SFs, it is also

possible that several devices perform data transmission at the

same time, using the same channel frequency without relevant

degradation of the received signal.

LORA modulation depends, basically, on three parame-

ters [30]: bandwidth (B), usually set to 125 kHz or 250 kHz for

uplink and 500 kHz for downlink; SF, denoted in the equations

by S ∈ {7, · · · , 12}; and the forward error correction rate

(FEC),

varying

to

.

It

possible

to

extract

from

these parameters the packet Time-on-Air (ToA), the receiver

sensitivity and the required signal to noise ratio (SNR) for

successful detection in the absence of interference. Table II

shows the relation among LORA parameters for a payload of

9 bytes at B = 125 kHz with CRC and Header Mode enabled.

It is possible to observe that ToA grows exponentially with SF,

reducing the bit rate while increasing the receiver sensitivity,

thus allowing higher coverage.

The implementation of LORA physical layer is agnostic of higher layers. One of the most widely used protocol stacks featuring a LORA PHY is LORAWAN, which implements a star topology and deﬁnes three types of devices: the enddevices (nodes), connected through a single-hop to one or more gateways, which in turn connect to a network server via an IP network. LORAWAN MAC is performed using unslotted ALOHA [29].
Moreover, the hardware of a LORA gateway can process up to nine channels in parallel, combining different sub-bands1 and SFs [1]. Besides that, LORA features the capture effect, making it possible to recover a LORA signal when two or more signals are received simultaneously, using the same frequency and the same SF, provided that the desired signal be at least 6 dB stronger than any other [7].

III. SYSTEM MODEL Following [6], consider that, on average, N¯ nodes are uniformly distributed around a gateway in a circular region of radius R and area V = πR2. In the coordinate system presented in Figure 1, the gateway is at the origin, and the nodes are deployed uniformly at random in the region V ⊆ R2 and transmit at random times. This distribution is described by an inhomogeneous Poisson point process (PPP) Φ with density ρ > 0 in V and 0 otherwise. In this scenario, di is the Euclidean distance between the gateway and the i-th node. Devices transmit in the uplink at random using the ALOHA protocol, obeying a duty cycle p0. Finally, SF is assigned
1A LORA sub-band is a set of frequency channels that devices in a network are conﬁgured to use.

according to the distance from the gateway di, increasing every 2000 m, while all nodes transmit with the same power Pi.

The uplink model considers that both path loss attenua-

tion g(di) and Rayleigh fading hi affect the received signal,

as in [6]. Path loss follows the Friis transmission equation

η

g(di) =

λ 4πdi

, where λ is the wavelength, and η ≥ 2 is the

path loss exponent. Rayleigh fading is modeled as a zero-mean,

independent, circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian random

variable with unit variance. Given a signal transmitted by a

LORA node s1, the received signal at the gateway, r1, is the sum of the attenuated transmitted signal, interference and

noise. It can be expressed as

N

r1 = g(d1)h1s1 + χSkg(dk)hksk + n,

(1)

k=2

where χSk is an indicator function equal to 1 if the k-th node is transmitting in the same SF of the desired signal at a given time or 0 otherwise, and n is additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with zero mean and variance N = −174 + F + 10 log(B) dBm, where F is the receiver noise ﬁgure, and B is the channel bandwidth.
The outage probability model follows [6], where the authors consider that the outage of LORA uplink occurs if either there is no connection between a node and the gateway or if there is a collision. This section brieﬂy presents the probability models introduced in [6], which are the basis for the extensions that include time and antenna diversity presented in the next sections.

A. Outage Condition 1: Disconnection
First, we consider the connection probability, which depends on the communication distance. A node is assumed as not connected to the gateway if the SNR of the received signal is below the reception threshold that allows successful detection in the absence of interference. Different SFs result in different receiver sensitivities which, in turn, result in different SNR reception thresholds (qS), as shown in Table II. The connection probability is thus

H1 = P[SNR ≥ qS|d1],

(2)

where qS is the SNR reception threshold of the SF (S) in use, and d1 is the distance between the desired node and the gateway.
Since we assume Rayleigh fading, the instantaneous SNR is exponentially distributed [5], and therefore

H1 = P

|h1|2

≥

N qS P1g(d1)

= exp

− N qS P1g(d1)

.

(3)

B. Outage Condition 2: Collision

Since LORA is a form of frequency modulation, it exhibits the capture effect [7], allowing stronger signals to suppress simultaneously received weaker signals. In LORA, a collision only takes place if the power difference between the desired signal and any other simultaneously received signal using the same SF and frequency channel is less than 6 dB. To evaluate this condition, one must consider the strongest interfering node k∗ deﬁned as

k∗

=

arg

max
k>1

{Pk χSk |hk |2 g (dk )}.

(4)

Once k∗ is found, the probability that no collision occurs or that the strongest interfering signal is at least 6 dB below the desired one, termed here as capture probability, is

Q1 = P

|h1|2g(d1) ≥ 4 |hk∗ |2g(dk∗ )

d1

= E|h1|2

P

Xk∗

<

|h1|2g(d1) 4

|h1|2, d1

. (5)

The above probability depends on the probability distribution of Xk∗ = |hk∗ |2g(dk∗ ). The cumulative distribution
function (CDF) of Xk∗ is derived in [6], and is denoted as
FXk∗ . Thus

Q1 = E|h1|2 FXk∗

Moreover, in [6] the authors present an approximation for (6) that is only accurate at the edges of each annulus in Figure 1. This paper considers only the exact probability in (6).

C. Coverage Probability

The coverage probability is the probability that the selected node is in coverage, i.e., it can successfully communicate considering both the connection and collision outage conditions above. The coverage probability of the desired node is thus merely the product H1Q1.
Moreover, the average coverage probability ℘c can be obtained by de-conditioning on the position of the desired node achieved by averaging in the network area,

2R

℘c = R2 0 H1(d1)Q1(d1)d1 dd1.

(7)

The remaining of this paper builds on the above model initially presented in [6] by including the required changes to take into account the effects of time and antenna diversity.
Additionally, different than [6], in this paper, we also consider the average coverage probability per SF (or per annulus). The coverage probability of a node in the annulus i is

2

li+1

℘c,i = (li+1 − li)2 li H1(d1)Q1(d1)(d1 − li) dd1, (8)

where li and li+1 are, respectively, the inner and outer radii of the i-th annulus, as illustrated in Figure 1.

IV. MESSAGE REPLICATIONS - TIME DIVERSITY

Many systems increase network reliability by using some form of automatic repeat request (ARQ) techniques, in which receivers automatically request the retransmission of lost packets. Although LORA systems can use such techniques, a recent study [9] has shown that LORA downlink cannot support the high demand of acknowledgment packets generated when all nodes in a dense network request such conﬁrmations, making delivery conﬁrmation an unreliable feature. To increase network reliability, however, other techniques can be applied, being message replication one of them.
The ﬁrst contribution of this paper is to analyze the effects of message replication in LORA networks, where each information message is transmitted M times within the same time interval when message replication is not used. Therefore, with message replication, there is an M -fold increase in the network duty cycle. Such technique increases the temporal diversity of the desired signal, thus making it much more likely that at least one message copy arrives at the gateway. The increase in the connectivity success probability is dependent on the number of replications M .
First, consider the extension of the connection probability to the case of message replications, denoted by H1,M . In this case, a connection outage only occurs if all M message copies are lost, therefore

H1,M = 1 − (1 − H1)M ,

(9)

where |h1|2 is assumed independent among replications. In a real deployment, one must consider that fading independence only takes place if the separation in time of each message copy is greater than the channel coherence time. In our simulations, we assume that this condition is always met [5].

Similar changes need to be made to the analysis of the capture probability. In this case, (5) can be rewritten to take into account the probability that at least one of the M message copies is received in the absence of interference or with the stronger interferer being at least 6 dB weaker,

Q1,M = 1 − (1 − Q1)M .

(10)

It is important to highlight that the derivation of FXk∗ in [6], required for evaluating Q1, deﬁnes the number of interfering nodes as a Poisson distribution with mean v = p0ρ|Vˆ (d1)|, where Vˆ (d1) is the area of the annulus of the desired node. In the case of message replication, once the transmission of
message copies increases the channel usage, when evaluating
(10) it is necessary to proportionally increase the mean of the Poisson distribution by making v = (M p0)ρ|Vˆ (d1)|.
We observed that the response of the average coverage probability (℘c,i) to variations in M shows an optimum point within the bounds of reasonable values of M . Thus, it is
possible to deﬁne the following optimization problem in the
form of an Integer Linear Program (ILP) to ﬁnd the optimum integer number of message copies M ∗ for each SF in a given
network conﬁguration. The ILP is

M ∗(i) = arg max ℘c,i =
M ∈Z

M ∈Z

(li+1 − li)2

li

H1,M (d1)Q1,M (d1)(d1 − li)dd1

subject to: 1 ≤ M ≤ Mmax,

(11)

where i is the annulus (and, thus, SF) under consideration and Mmax is the maximum value considered for M ∗. In this work, we solved this ILP by exhaustively enumerating ℘c,i for all possible values of M . This is a viable option since the set
of possible values of M is small.

V. MULTIPLE RECEIVE ANTENNAS - SPATIAL DIVERSITY

The second contribution of this paper is to analyze the gain in coverage probability of LORA networks when using multiple receive antennas at the gateway to achieving spatial diversity. Note that the application of a technique such as maximum ratio combining [5] is not feasible in this case, as we consider the use of commercial LoRa radios. As the gateway can only tune to a particular user if the Signal-Interference Ratio (SIR) is at least 6dB (considering nodes with the same SF), it would be not possible to combine several branches with SIRs below 6dB to achieve a combined signal with SIR of at least 6dB. The alternative, thus, is to consider an approach based on the selection combining technique [5].
In this case, the adaptation of the connection probability from (2) is straightforward. It is assumed that A receive antennas are sufﬁciently spaced apart so that the fading is independent among them. Therefore, successful connection in the absence of interference is achieved if the SNR in at least one of the antennas is above the detection threshold

H1,A = 1 − (1 − H1)A.

By its turn, the capture probability is concerned with col-
lisions from interfering signals and demands a more intricate
mathematical development. Here, the strongest interfering signal seen by the i-th antenna is denoted by ki∗ and deﬁned as

ki∗

=

arg

max
k>1

{Pk χSk |hi,k |2 g (dk )},

(13)

where hi,k is the channel fading of the k-th node and the i-th antenna. Thus, the probability that there is no collision in at least one of the antennas is

Q1,A = P i=m1,a··x· ,ASIR∗i < 4 d1 ,

(14)

SIR∗i

=

|hi,1 |hi,ki∗

|2 |2

g(d1) g(dki∗

)

,

(15)

where hi,1 is the channel fading of the desired node with antenna i, and SIR is the signal to interference ratio.
Note that the distribution of Xki∗ = |hi,ki∗ |2g(dki∗ ) is correlated among antennas, as g(dki∗ ) is the same for all antennas. Thus, it seems intractable to make analytic progress
from (14). However, a lower bound on the capture probability
can be obtained as

Q1,A ≥ P

max SIRi < 4 d1
i=1,··· ,A

= Ql1o,A,

(16)

where

SIRi =

|hi,1|2g(d1)

= |hi,1|2d−1 η ,

χSk |hi,k |2 g (dk )

Ii

(17)

k>1

with

Ii = χSk|hi,k|2d−k η.
k>1

(18)

Compared with (14), in this case, we consider the sum of all interfering signals instead of the stronger interfering signal only. Since SIRi < SIR∗i , (16) is a lower bound. As we shall see in Section VI, the bound can be very tight if concurrent transmissions from more than two devices are not frequent, which is expected in most LORA scenarios, since duty cycle is typically very low [8].
To evolve on the mathematical analysis, we consider the development presented by Haenggi [31]. Let us deﬁne the
events Si = {SIRi > 4}. We focus ﬁrst on the probability of the joint occurrence of z of these events,





Pz = P 

Si ,

(19)

i=1,··· ,z

i.e., the probability that the SIR exceeds 6 dB at z antennas at the same time. Thus,

Pz = P[|h1,1|2 > 4dη1I1, · · · , |hz,1|2 > 4dη1Iz].

(20)

Since Ii, i ∈ {1, · · · , z}, are correlated through the common randomness Φ (the point process of the nodes) and |hi,1|2 is

exponentially distributed, we have that

VI. NUMERICAL RESULTS
This section evaluates the proposed models using numerical simulations. In the ﬁgures shown here, solid lines represent theoretical probabilities while points of the same color represent the results of Monte Carlo simulations. Each simulation point is the averaged result of 105 random deployment scenarios. Results are shown for p0 = {0.1, 0.5}%, which is equivalent to {3.6, 18.1} messages per hour with S = 12, or {87.3, 436.7} messages per hour with S = 7. These are worst-case considerations of the LORA reality. In practice, typical LORA applications are expected to operate with duty cycles below 0.1%, and rarely above 0.5% [8]. Moreover, following [6], all results presented in this paper consider F = 6 dBm, η = 2.75, λ = c/f m, f = 868 MHz, B = 125 kHz, which are typical conﬁgurations for sub-urban scenarios following European regulations.

A. Baseline Model - Without Diversity
Figure 2 shows the performance of the baseline model of Section III, with varying duty cycle and an average number of nodes of N¯ = 500, without any time or antenna diversity, i.e., M = 1, A = 1. There is no need to vary both duty cycle and the average number of nodes in the simulations because the model is sensitive to the medium usage, the product p0N¯ , rather than on these parameters separately. The ﬁgure shows the connection probability H1, capture probability Q1, and coverage probability H1Q1 in separated curves. As

expected, results for H1 are not dependent on duty cycle or the average number of nodes because H1 models the connection probability, which depends only on the distance. It makes Q1 primarily responsible for network quality degradation. That happens because Q1 takes interference into account, which is substantially affected by increasing medium usage.
It is also possible to note that Q1 decreases with SF, what is expected behavior and happens due to the combination of two factors. The ﬁrst one is that ToA increases with SF (see Table II). The second one is that, because outer annuli are bigger than inner annuli, and nodes are distributed uniformly in the circular region around the gateway, the scenario has more nodes using higher SFs.

conﬁguration of the results presented in Figure 2(b), except for the value of M . As expected, message replication has a substantial positive impact on H1,M because M decreases this outage condition exponentially. For Q1,M , however, the positive impact only exists as long as the message copies do not ﬂood the network, reaching a point where the number of collisions is too high. Moreover, message replication performs better in lower SF than higher SF, what happens because ToA nearly doubles for each SF increase, making it faster to ﬂood the network with message replications when using higher SFs.
Figure 4 shows the average coverage probability ℘c,i with each value of SF, for a varying number of message copies M . It is possible to observe that the best number of message replications is different for each SF conﬁguration. Table III summarizes, for each SF and the entire network, the optimum number of message copies (M ∗) and the corresponding average coverage probability for the annulus that is using

that SF. The last column of the table shows the average coverage probability of the network if each node uses the M ∗ computed for its SF. To allow comparison, the last line of the table shows the coverage probability without message replication. Note that the optimum number of message copies is a decreasing function of the SF, what makes sense since message replications increase the network density.
C. Multiple Receive Antennas
Figure 5 shows the performance for A = {1, 2, 4} receive antennas at the gateway, in a scenario with p0 = 0.5%, N¯ = 500 and M = 1. It is evident the tightness of the lower bound given in (22). In a different way from what happens with message replication, the growth of the delivery probability in LORA networks with multiple receive antennas is a monotonic function of the number of antennas A. The more receive antennas a gateway has, the better. Figures 5(b) and 5(c) show that multiple receive antennas bring an average gain in H1Q1 probability of 1.5× and 1.97× for, respectively, A = 2 and A = 4. This gain results in the average coverage ℘c[H1Q1] going from 39.44% to 59.27% and 77.69%, respectively.
Table IV presents the performance for the integration of both time and antenna diversity. It shows the average coverage probability ℘c[H1Q1] in the deployment area for different duty cycles (p0), different average number of nodes (N¯ ), and a varying number of receive antennas (A). Results consider the

optimum number of message copies (M ∗) for each conﬁguration. It is possible to conclude that low-density networks like the ones with p0 = 0.1%, N¯ = 500 can achieve performance gains with message replication alone. Networks slightly more dense like the ones with p0 = 0.1%, N¯ = {1000, 1500} can achieve reasonably high performance gains by combining both techniques. Performance gains for dense networks, on the other hand, depend much more on antenna diversity to achieve larger beneﬁts, since message replications contribute to an excessive increase in collision probability. The denser cases shown in Table IV, p0 = 0.5%, N¯ = {1000, 1500}, demonstrate that message replication may not be an option for similar cases. Regardless of the network density, the results show that the careful use of both techniques can achieve signiﬁcant gains.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
This paper analyzed the use of time and spatial diversity to enhance the uplink performance in LORA networks through message replication and multiple receive antennas. Theoretical modeling and computer simulations were used to investigate the proposed methods. For message replication, there is an optimal number of copies to be employed in each network conﬁguration. Moreover, replication is very useful in lowdensity networks, while multiple receive antennas are always beneﬁcial. Finally, the adequate combination of both techniques can considerably improve the network performance.
Future work can consider the optimization of message replication taking into account energy efﬁciency, as well as the allocation of different M for different users in a way to favor nodes that require a larger Quality-of-Service (QoS). Moreover, spatial diversity can also be exploited in a macro sense, with multiple gateways with multiple receive antennas. The adequate allocation of SF for each user is also an interesting open problem in each of the above cases.
