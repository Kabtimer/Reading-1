LoRaWAN Specification

1 1 Introduction

2 This document describes the LoRaWAN™ network protocol which is optimized for battery3 powered end-devices that may be either mobile or mounted at a fixed location.
4 LoRaWAN networks typically are laid out in a star-of-stars topology in which gateways1 5 relay messages between end-devices2 and a central network server at the backend. 6 Gateways are connected to the network server via standard IP connections while end7 devices use single-hop LoRa™ or FSK communication to one or many gateways.3 All 8 communication is generally bi-directional, although uplink communication from an end9 device to the network server is expected to be the predominant traffic.

10 Communication between end-devices and gateways is spread out on different frequency 11 channels and data rates. The selection of the data rate is a trade-off between 12 communication range and message duration, communications with different data rates do 13 not interfere with each other. LoRa data rates range from 0.3 kbps to 50 kbps. To maximize 14 both battery life of the end-devices and overall network capacity, the LoRa network 15 infrastructure can manage the data rate and RF output for each end-device individually by 16 means of an adaptive data rate (ADR) scheme.

17 End-devices may transmit on any channel available at any time, using any available data 18 rate, as long as the following rules are respected:

19

 The end-device changes channel in a pseudo-random fashion for every

20

transmission. The resulting frequency diversity makes the system more robust to

21

interferences.

22

 The end-device respects the maximum transmit duty cycle relative to the sub-band

23

used and local regulations.

24

 The end-device respects the maximum transmit duration (or dwell time) relative to

25

the sub-band used and local regulations.

26

Note: Maximum transmit duty-cycle and dwell time per sub-band are

27

region specific and are defined in the Chapter 6.

28 1.1 LoRaWAN Classes
29 All LoRaWAN devices implement at least the Class A functionality as described in this 30 document. In addition they may implement options named Class B, Class C as also 31 described in this document or others to be defined. In all cases, they must remain 32 compatible with Class A.

1 Gateways are also known as concentrators or base stations. 2 End-devices are also known as motes. 3 Support for intermediate elements – repeaters – is not described in the document, however payload restrictions for encapsulation overhead are included in this specification. A repeater is defined as using LoRaWAN as its backhaul mechanism.

1 2 Introduction on LoRaWAN options
2 LoRa™ is a wireless modulation for long-range low-power low-data-rate applications 3 developed by Semtech. Devices implementing more than Class A are generally named 4 ―higher Class end-devices‖ in this document.
5 2.1 LoRaWAN Classes
6 A LoRa network distinguishes between a basic LoRaWAN (named Class A) and optional 7 features (Class B, Class C …):

 Bi-directional end-devices (Class A): End-devices of Class A allow for bi-

11

directional communications whereby each end-device‘s uplink transmission is

12

followed by two short downlink receive windows. The transmission slot scheduled by

13

the end-device is based on its own communication needs with a small variation

14

based on a random time basis (ALOHA-type of protocol). This Class A operation is

15

the lowest power end-device system for applications that only require downlink

16

communication from the server shortly after the end-device has sent an uplink

17

transmission. Downlink communications from the server at any other time will have to

18

wait until the next scheduled uplink.

19

 Bi-directional end-devices with scheduled receive slots (Class B): End-devices

20

of Class B allow for more receive slots. In addition to the Class A random receive

21

windows, Class B devices open extra receive windows at scheduled times. In order

22

for the End-device to open it receive window at the scheduled time it receives a time

23

synchronized Beacon from the gateway. This allows the server to know when the

24

end-device is listening.

25

 Bi-directional end-devices with maximal receive slots (Class C): End-devices of

26

Class C have nearly continuously open receive windows, only closed when

27

transmitting. Class C end-device will use more power to operate than Class A or

28

Class B but they offer the lowest latency for server to end-device communication.

1 3 Physical Message Formats
2 The LoRa terminology distinguishes between uplink and downlink messages.

3 3.1 Uplink Messages

4 Uplink messages are sent by end-devices to the network server relayed by one or many 5 gateways.

6 Uplink messages use the LoRa radio packet explicit mode in which the LoRa physical 7 header (PHDR) plus a header CRC (PHDR_CRC) are included.1 The integrity of the payload
8 is protected by a CRC.

9 The PHDR, PHDR_CRC and payload CRC fields are inserted by the radio transceiver.

12 3.2 Downlink Messages

13 Each downlink message is sent by the network server to only one end-device and is 14 relayed by a single gateway.2

15 Downlink messages use the radio packet explicit mode in which the LoRa physical header 16 (PHDR) and a header CRC (PHDR_CRC) are included.3

20 Following each uplink transmission the end-device opens two short receive windows. The 21 receive window start times is a configured periods are the end of the transmission of the last 22 uplink bit.

1 See the LoRa radio transceiver datasheet for a description of LoRa radio packet implicit/explicit modes. 2 This specification does not describe the transmission of multicast messages from a network server to many end-devices. 3 No payload integrity check is done at this level to keep messages as short as possible with minimum impact on any duty-cycle limitations of the ISM bands used.

3 3.3.1 First receive window channel, data rate, and start 4 The first receive window RX1 uses the same frequency channel as the uplink and a data 5 rate that is a function of the data rate used for the uplink. RX1 opens RECEIVE_DELAY11 6 seconds (+/- 20 microseconds) after the end of the uplink modulation. The relationship 7 between uplink and RX1 slot downlink data rate is region specific and detailed in the Section 8 7. By default the first receive window datarate is identical to the datarate of the last uplink.
9 3.3.2 Second receive window channel, data rate, and start 10 The second receive window RX2 uses a fixed configurable frequency and data rate and 11 opens RECEIVE_DELAY21 seconds (+/- 20 microseconds) after the end of the uplink 12 modulation. The frequency and data rate used can be modified through MAC commands 13 (see Section 5).The default frequency and data rate to use are region specific and detailed 14 in the Section 7 .
15 3.3.3 Receive window duration 16 The length of a receive window must be at least the time required by the end-device‘s radio 17 transceiver to effectively detect a downlink preamble.
18 3.3.4 Receiver activity during the receive windows 19 If a preamble is detected during one of the receive windows, the radio receiver stays active 20 until the downlink frame is demodulated. If a frame was detected and subsequently 21 demodulated during the first receive window and the frame was intended for this end-device 22 after address and MIC (message integrity code) checks, the end-device does not open the 23 second receive window.
24 3.3.5 Network sending a message to an end-device 25 If the network intends to transmit a downlink to an end-device, it will always initiate the 26 transmission precisely at the beginning of one of those two receive windows.

1 4.3 MAC Payload of Data Messages (MACPayload)
2 The MAC payload of the data messages, a so-called ―data frame‖, contains a frame header 3 (FHDR) followed by an optional port field (FPort) and an optional frame payload field 4 (FRMPayload).

5 4.3.1 Frame header (FHDR)

6 The FHDR contains the short device address of the end-device (DevAddr), a frame control

7 octet (FCtrl), a 2-octets frame counter (FCnt), and up to 15 octets of frame options (FOpts)

12 4.3.1.1 Adaptive data rate control in frame header (ADR, ADRACKReq in FCtrl)

13 LoRa network allows the end-devices to individually use any of the possible data rates. This 14 feature is used by the LoRaWAN to adapt and optimize the data rate of static end-devices. 15 This is referred to as Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) and when this is enabled the network will be 16 optimized to use the fastest data rate possible.

17 Mobile end-devices should use their fixed default data rate as data rate management is not 18 practical when the moving end-device causes fast changes in the radio environment.

19 If the ADR bit is set, the network will control the data rate of the end-device through the 20 appropriate MAC commands. If the ADR bit is not set, the network will not attempt to control 21 the data rate of the end-device regardless of the received signal quality. The ADR bit may 22 be set and unset by the end-device or the Network on demand. However, whenever 23 possible, the ADR scheme should be enabled to increase the battery life of the end-device 24 and maximize the network capacity.

25

Note: Even mobile end-devices are actually immobile most of the time.

26

So depending on its state of mobility, an end-device can request the

27

network to optimize its data rate using ADR.

28 If an end-device whose data rate is optimized by the network to use a data rate higher than 29 its default data rate, it periodically needs to validate that the network still receives the uplink 30 frames. Each time the uplink frame counter is incremented (for each new uplink, repeated 31 transmissions do not increase the counter), the device increments an ADR_ACK_CNT 32 counter. After ADR_ACK_LIMIT uplinks (ADR_ACK_CNT >= ADR_ACK_LIMIT) without any 33 downlink response, it sets the ADR acknowledgment request bit (ADRACKReq). The 34 network is required to respond with a downlink frame within the time set by the 35 ADR_ACK_DELAY, any received downlink frame following an uplink frame resets the 36 ADR_ACK_CNT counter. The downlink ACK bit does not need to be set as any response 37 during the receive slot of the end-device indicates that the gateway has still received the 38 uplinks from this device. If no reply is received within the next ADR_ACK_DELAY uplinks

LoRaWAN Specification

1 (i.e., after a total of ADR_ACK_LIMIT + ADR_ACK_DELAY), the end-device may try to 2 regain connectivity by switching to the next lower data rate that provides a longer radio 3 range. The end-device will further lower its data rate step by step every time 4 ADR_ACK_LIMIT is reached. The ADRACKReq shall not be set if the device uses its 5 default data rate because in that case no action can be taken to improve the link range.

6

Note: Not requesting an immediate response to an ADR

7

acknowledgement request provides flexibility to the network to

8

optimally schedule its downlinks.

9

10

Note: In uplink transmissions the ADRACKReq bit is set if

11

ADR_ACK_CNT >= ADR_ACK_LIMIT and the current data-rate is

12

greater than the device defined minimum data rate, it is cleared in

13

other conditions.

14 4.3.1.2 Message acknowledge bit and acknowledgement procedure (ACK in FCtrl)

15 When receiving a confirmed data message, the receiver shall respond with a data frame that 16 has the acknowledgment bit (ACK) set. If the sender is an end-device, the network will send 17 the acknowledgement using one of the receive windows opened by the end-device after the 18 send operation. If the sender is a gateway, the end-device transmits an acknowledgment at 19 its own discretion.

20 Acknowledgements are only sent in response to the latest message received and are never 21 retransmitted.

22

23

Note: To allow the end-devices to be as simple as possible and have

24

as few states as possible it may transmit an explicit (possibly empty)

25

acknowledgement data message immediately after the reception of a

26

data message requiring a confirmation. Alternatively the end-device

27

may defer the transmission of an acknowledgement to piggyback it

28

with its next data message.

29 4.3.1.3 Retransmission procedure

30 The number of retransmissions (and their timing) for the same message where an 31 acknowledgment is requested but not received is at the discretion of the end device and 32 may be different for each end-device, it can also be set or adjusted from the network server.

33

Note: Some example timing diagrams of the acknowledge mechanism

34

are given in Chapter 18.

35

36

Note: If an end-device has reached its maximum number of

37

retransmissions without receiving an acknowledgment, it can try to re-

38

gain connectivity by moving to a lower data rate with longer reach. It is

39

up to the end-device to retransmit the message again or to forfeit that

40

message and move on.

41

42

Note: If the network server has reached its maximum number of

43

retransmissions without receiving an acknowledgment, it will generally

44

consider the end-device as unreachable until it receives further

LoRaWAN Specification

1

messages from the end-device. It is up to the network server to

2

retransmit the message once connectivity to the end-device in question

3

is regained or to forfeit that message and move on.

4

5

Note: The recommended data rate back-off strategy during re-

6

transmissions is described in Chapter 18.4

7 4.3.1.4 Frame pending bit (FPending in FCtrl, downlink only)
8 The frame pending bit (FPending) is only used in downlink communication, indicating that 9 the gateway has more data pending to be sent and therefore asking the end-device to open 10 another receive window as soon as possible by sending another uplink message.
11 The exact use of FPending bit is described in Chapter 18.3.

12 4.3.1.5 Frame counter (FCnt)

13 Each end-device has two frame counters to keep track of the number of data frames sent 14 uplink to the network server (FCntUp), incremented by the end-device and received by the 15 end-device downlink from the network server (FCntDown), which is incremented by the 16 network server. The network server tracks the uplink frame counter and generates the 17 downlink counter for each end-device. After a join accept, the frame counters on the end18 device and the frame counters on the network server for that end-device are reset to 0. 19 Subsequently FCntUp and FCntDown are incremented at the sender side by 1 for each data 20 frame sent in the respective direction. At the receiver side, the corresponding counter is 21 kept in sync with the value received provided the value received has incremented compared 22 to the current counter value and is less than the value specified by MAX_FCNT_GAP1 after 23 considering counter rollovers. If this difference is greater than the value of MAX_FCNY_GAP 24 then too many data frames have been lost then subsequent will be discarded.

25 The LoRaWAN allows the use of either 16-bits or 32-bits frame counters. The network side 26 needs to be informed out-of-band about the width of the frame counter implemented in a 27 given end-device. If a 16-bits frame counter is used, the FCnt field can be used directly as 28 the counter value, possibly extended by leading zero octets if required. If a 32-bits frame 29 counter is used, the FCnt field corresponds to the least-significant 16 bits of the 32-bits 30 frame counter (i.e., FCntUp for data frames sent uplink and FCntDown for data frames sent 31 downlink).

32 The end-device shall not reuse the same FCntUp value, except for retransmission, with the 33 same application and network session keys.

34

Note: Since the FCnt field carries only the least-significant 16 bits of

35

the 32-bits frame counter, the server must infer the 16 most-significant

36

bits of the frame counter from the observation of the traffic.

37 4.3.1.6 Frame options (FOptsLen in FCtrl, FOpts)
38 The frame-options length field (FOptsLen) in FCtrl byte denotes the actual length of the 39 frame options field (FOpts) included in the frame.

1 Actual value for MAX_FCNT_GAP, RECEIVE_DELAY1 and RECEIVE_DELAY2 can be found at 7.1.7 for EU863-870 or 7.2.7 for US902-928.

1 FOpts transport MAC commands of a maximum length of 15 octets that are piggybacked 2 onto data frames; see Chapter 4.4 for a list of valid MAC commands.
3 If FOptsLen is 0, the FOpts field is absent. If FOptsLen is different from 0, i.e. if MAC 4 commands are present in the FOpts field, the port 0 cannot be used (FPort must be either 5 not present or different from 0).
6 MAC commands cannot be simultaneously present in the payload field and the frame 7 options field.

8 4.3.2 Port field (FPort)

9 If the frame payload field is not empty, the port field must be present. If present, an FPort

10 value of 0 indicates that the FRMPayload contains MAC commands only; see Chapter 4.4

11 for a list of valid MAC commands. FPort values 1..223 (0x01..0xDF) are application-

12 specific. FPort values 224..255 (0xE0..0xFF) are reserved for future standardized

where M is the maximum MAC payload length.

20 4.3.3 MAC Frame Payload Encryption (FRMPayload)
21 If a data frame carries a payload, FRMPayload must be encrypted before the message 22 integrity code (MIC) is calculated.
23 The encryption scheme used is based on the generic algorithm described in IEEE 24 802.15.4/2006 Annex B [IEEE802154] using AES with a key length of 128 bits.
25 As a default, the encryption/decryption is done by the LoRaWAN layer for all FPort. The 26 encryption/decryption may be done above the LoRaWAN layer for specific FPorts except 0, 27 if this is more convenient for the application. The information concerning which FPort from 28 which node is encrypted/decrypted outside of the LoRaWAN layer must be communicated to 29 the server using an out-of-band channel (see Section 19).

12 4.3.3.2 Encryption above the LoRaWAN layer
13 If the layers above LoRaWAN provide pre-encrypted FRMPayload to LoRaWAN on selected 14 ports (but not on FPort 0 which is reserved for MAC commands), LoRaWAN transfers 15 FRMPayload from MACPayload to the application and FRMPayload from the application to 16 MACPayload without any modification of FRMPayload.

1 5 MAC Commands

2 For network administration, a set of MAC commands may be exchanged exclusively 3 between the network server and the MAC layer on an end-device. MAC layer commands 4 are never visible to the application or the application server or the application running on the 5 end-device.

6 A single data frame can contain any sequence of MAC commands, either piggybacked in the 7 FOpts field or, when sent as a separate data frame, in the FRMPayload field with the FPort 8 field being set to 0. Piggybacked MAC commands are always sent without encryption and 9 must not exceed 15 octets. MAC commands sent as FRMPayload are always encrypted 10 and must not exceed the maximum FRMPayload length.

11

Note: MAC commands whose content shall not be disclosed to an

12

eavesdropper must be sent in the FRMPayload of a separate data

13

message.

8 In the Redundancy bits the number of repetitions (NbRep) field is the number of repetition 9 for each uplink message. This applies only to ―unconfirmed‖ uplink frames. The default value 10 is 1. The valid range is [1:15]. If NbRep==0 is received the end-device should use the 11 default value. This field can be used by the network manager to control the redundancy of 12 the node uplinks to obtain a given Quality of Service. The end-device performs frequency 13 hopping as usual between repeated transmissions, it does wait after each repetition until the 14 receive windows have expired.

15 The channel mask control (ChMaskCntl) field controls the interpretation of the previously 16 defined ChMask bit mask. This field will only be non-zero values in networks where more 17 than 16 channels are implemented. It controls the block of 16 channels to which the 18 ChMask applies. It can also be used to globally turn on or off all channels using specific 19 modulation. This field usage is region specific and is defined in Chapter 7.

20 The channel frequencies are region-specific and they are defined in Chapter 6. An end-

17 The channel index (ChIndex) is the index of the channel being created or modified. 18 Depending on the region and frequency band used, the LoRaWAN specification imposes 19 default channels which must be common to all devices and cannot be modified by the 20 NewChannelReq command (cf. Chapter 6). If the number of default channels is N, the 21 default channels go from 0 to N-1, and the acceptable range for ChIndex is N to 15. A 22 device must be able to handle at least 16 different channel definitions. In certain region the 23 device may have to store more than 16 channel definitions. 24

25 The frequency (Freq) field is a 24 bits unsigned integer. The actual channel frequency in Hz 26 is 100 x Freq whereby values representing frequencies below 100 MHz are reserved for 27 future use. This allows setting the frequency of a channel anywhere between 100 MHz to 28 1.67 GHz in 100 Hz steps. A Freq value of 0 disables the channel. The end-device has to 29 check that the frequency is actually allowed by its radio hardware and return an error 30 otherwise. 31

32 The data-rate range (DrRange) field specifies the data-rate range allowed for this channel.

33 The field is split in two 4-bit indexes:

Similarly, the maximum data rate (MaxDR) designates the highest data rate. For 5 example, DrRange = 0x77 means that only 50 kbps GFSK is allowed on a channel and 6 DrRange = 0x50 means that DR0 / 125 kHz to DR5 / 125 kHz are supported.

LoRaWAN Specification

1 6 End-Device Activation
2 To participate in a LoRaWAN network, each end-device has to be personalized and 3 activated.
4 Activation of an end-device can be achieved in two ways, either via Over-The-Air 5 Activation (OTAA) when an end-device is deployed or reset, or via Activation By 6 Personalization (ABP) in which the two steps of end-device personalization and activation 7 are done as one step.

8 6.1 Data Stored in the End-device after Activation
9 After activation, the following information is stored in the end-device: a device address 10 (DevAddr), an application identifier (AppEUI), a network session key (NwkSKey), and an 11 application session key (AppSKey).

12 6.1.1 End-device address (DevAddr)

13 The DevAddr consists of 32 bits identifies the end-device within the current network. Its

14 format is as follows:

Bit#

[31..25]

[24..0]

DevAddr bits

NwkID

NwkAddr

15 The most significant 7 bits are used as network identifier (NwkID) to separate addresses of 16 territorially overlapping networks of different network operators and to remedy roaming 17 issues. The least significant 25 bits, the network address (NwkAddr) of the end-device, can 18 be arbitrarily assigned by the network manager.

19 6.1.2 Application identifier (AppEUI)
20 The AppEUI is a global application ID in IEEE EUI64 address space that uniquely identifies 21 the application provider (i.e., owner) of the end-device.
22 The AppEUI is stored in the end-device before the activation procedure is executed.

23 6.1.3 Network session key (NwkSKey)
24 The NwkSKey is a network session key specific for the end-device. It is used by both the 25 network server and the end-device to calculate and verify the MIC (message integrity code) 26 of all data messages to ensure data integrity. It is further used to encrypt and decrypt the 27 payload field of a MAC-only data messages.

28 6.1.4 Application session key (AppSKey)
29 The AppSKey is an application session key specific for the end-device. It is used by both 30 the network server and the end-device to encrypt and decrypt the payload field of 31 application-specific data messages. It is also used to calculate and verify an application32 level MIC that may be included in the payload of application-specific data messages.

33 6.2 Over-the-Air Activation

34 For over-the-air activation, end-devices must follow a join procedure prior to participating in 35 data exchanges with the network server. An end-device has to go through a new join 36 procedure every time it has lost the session context information.

©2015 LoRa™ Alliance

Page 30 of 82

The authors reserve the right to change specifications without notice.

LoRaWAN Specification

1 The join procedure requires the end-device to be personalized with the following information 2 before its starts the join procedure: a globally unique end-device identifier (DevEUI), the 3 application identifier (AppEUI), and an AES-128 key (AppKey).

4 The AppEUI is described above in 6.1.2.

5

Note: For over-the-air-activation, end-devices are not personalized

6

with any kind of network key. Instead, whenever an end-device joins a

7

network, a network session key specific for that end-device is derived

8

to encrypt and verify transmissions at the network level. This way,

9

roaming of end-devices between networks of different providers is

10

facilitated. Using both a network session key and an application

11

session key further allows federated network servers in which

12

application data cannot be read or tampered with by the network

13

provider.

14 6.2.1 End-device identifier (DevEUI)
15 The DevEUI is a global end-device ID in IEEE EUI64 address space that uniquely identifies 16 the end-device.

17 6.2.2 Application key (AppKey)
18 The AppKey is an AES-128 application key specific for the end-device that is assigned by 19 the application owner to the end-device and most likely derived from an application-specific 20 root key exclusively known to and under the control of the application provider.1 Whenever 21 an end-device joins a network via over-the-air activation, the AppKey is used to derive the 22 session keys NwkSKey and AppSKey specific for that end-device to encrypt and verify 23 network communication and application data.

24 6.2.3 Join procedure
25 From an end-device‘s point of view, the join procedure consists of two MAC messages 26 exchanged with the server, namely a join request and a join accept.

27 6.2.4 Join-request message

28 The join procedure is always initiated from the end-device by sending a join-request

29 message.

30

Join Request

AppEUI

DevEUI

DevNonce

31 The join-request message contains the AppEUI and DevEUI of the end-device followed by a 32 nonce of 2 octets (DevNonce).
33 DevNonce is a random value.2 For each end-device, the network server keeps track of a 34 certain number of DevNonce values used by the end-device in the past, and ignores join 35 requests with any of these DevNonce values from that end-device.

1. Since all end-devices end up with unrelated application keys specific for each end-device, extracting the AppKey from an end-device only compromises this one end-device. 2 The DevNonce can be extracted by issuing a sequence of RSSI measurements under the assumption that the quality of randomness fulfills the criteria of true randomness

Note: This mechanism prevents replay attacks by sending previously

2

recorded join-request messages with the intention of disconnecting the

3

respective end-device from the network.

4 The message integrity code (MIC) value (see Chapter 4 for MAC message description) for a

5 join-request message is calculated as follows:1

6

7

cmac = aes128_cmac(AppKey, MHDR | AppEUI | DevEUI | DevNonce)

8

MIC = cmac[0..3]

9 The join-request message is not encrypted.

10 6.2.5 Join-accept message

11 The network server will respond to the join-request message with a join-accept message if 12 the end-device is permitted to join a network. The join-accept message is sent like a normal 13 downlink but uses delays JOIN_ACCEPT_DELAY1 or JOIN_ACCEPT_DELAY2 (instead of 14 RECEIVE_DELAY1 and RECEIVE_DELAY2, respectively). The channel frequency and data 15 rate used for these two receive windows are identical to the one used for the RX1 and RX2 16 receive windows described in the ―receive windows‖ section of the ―Physical Layer‖ chapter

17 No response is given to the end-device if the join request is not accepted.

18 The join-accept message contains an application nonce (AppNonce) of 3 octets, a network 19 identifier (NetID), an end-device address (DevAddr), a delay between TX and RX 20 (RxDelay) and an optional list of channel frequencies (CFList) for the network the end21 device is joining. The CFList option is region specific and is defined in Section 7.

23 The AppNonce is a random value or some form of unique ID provided by the network server

24 and used by the end-device to derive the two session keys NwkSKey and AppSKey as 25 follows:3

26 NwkSKey = aes128_encrypt(AppKey, 0x01 | AppNonce | NetID | DevNonce | pad16) 27 AppSKey = aes128_encrypt(AppKey, 0x02 | AppNonce | NetID | DevNonce | pad16)

28 The MIC value for a join-accept message is calculated as follows:4

29 cmac = aes128_cmac(AppKey,

30

MHDR | AppNonce | NetID | DevAddr | RFU | RxDelay | CFList)

31 MIC = cmac[0..3]

32 The join-accept message itself is encrypted with the AppKey as follows: 33 aes128_decrypt(AppKey, AppNonce | NetID | DevAddr | RFU | RxDelay | CFList | MIC)

34

Note: The network server uses an AES decrypt operation in ECB

35

mode to encrypt the join-accept message so that the end-device can

36

use an AES encrypt operation to decrypt the message. This way an

37

end-device only has to implement AES encrypt but not AES decrypt.

Note: Establishing these two session keys allows for a federated

2

network server infrastructure in which network operators are not able

3

to eavesdrop on application data. In such a setting, the application

4

provider must support the network operator in the process of an end-

5

device actually joining the network and establishing the NwkSKey for

6

the end-device. At the same time the application provider commits to

7

the network operator that it will take the charges for any traffic incurred

8

by the end-device and retains full control over the AppSKey used for

9

protecting its application data.

10 The format of the NetID is as follows: The seven LSB of the NetID are called NwkID and 11 match the seven MSB of the short address of an end-device as described before. 12 Neighboring or overlapping networks must have different NwkIDs. The remaining 17 MSB 13 can be freely chosen by the network operator.

17 The RX1DRoffset field sets the offset between the uplink data rate and the downlink data

18 rate used to communicate with the end-device on the first reception slot (RX1). By default

19 this offset is 0. The downlink data rate is always lower or equal than the uplink data rate. The

20 offset is used to take into account maximum power density constraints for base stations in

21 some regions and to balance the uplink and downlink radio link margins.

22 The actual relationship between the uplink and downlink data rate is region specific and 23 detailed in the ―Physical Layer‖ section

24 The delay RxDelay follows the same convention as the Delay field in the 25 RXTimingSetupReq command.

26 6.3 Activation by Personalization
27 Under certain circumstances, end-devices can be activated by personalization. Activation by 28 personalization directly ties an end-device to a specific network by-passing the join request 29 - join accept procedure.
30 Activating an end-device by personalization means that the DevAddr and the two session 31 keys NwkSKey and AppSKey are directly stored into the end-device instead of the DevEUI, 32 AppEUI and the AppKey. The end-device is equipped with the required information for 33 participating in a specific LoRa network when started.
34 Each device should have a unique set of NwkSKey and AppSKey. Compromising the keys 35 of one device shouldn‘t compromise the security of the communications of other devices. 36 The process to build those keys should be such that the keys cannot be derived in any way 37 from publicly available information (like the node address for example).

14 In order to access the physical medium the ETSI regulations impose some restrictions such 15 maximum time the transmitter can be on or the maximum time a transmitter can transmit per 16 hour. The ETSI regulations allow the choice of using either a duty-cycle limitation or a so17 called Listen Before Talk Adaptive Frequency Agility (LBT AFA) transmissions 18 management. The current LoRaWAN specification exclusively uses duty-cycled limited 19 transmissions to comply with the ETSI regulations.
20 The LoRaWAN enforces a per sub-band duty-cycle limitation. Each time a frame is 21 transmitted in a given sub-band, the time of emission and the on-air duration of the frame 22 are recorded for this sub-band. The same sub-band cannot be used again during the next 23 Toff seconds where:

24 During the unavailable time of a given sub-band, the device may still be able to transmit on 25 another sub-band. If all sub-bands are unavailable, the device has to wait before any further 26 transmission. The device adapts its channel hoping sequence according to the sub-band 27 availability.
28 Example: A device just transmitted a 0.5 s long frame on one default channel. This channel 29 is in a sub-band allowing 1% duty-cycle. Therefore this whole sub-band (868 – 868.6) will be 30 unavailable for 49.5 s.

14 EU433 end-devices should be capable of operating in the 433.05 to 434.79 MHz frequency 15 band and should feature a channel data structure to store the parameters of at least 16 16 channels. A channel data structure corresponds to a frequency and a set of data rates 17 usable on this frequency.

18 The first three channels correspond to 433.175, 433.375 and 433.575 MHz with DR0 to DR5 19 and must be implemented in every end-device. Those default channels cannot be modified 20 through the NewChannelReq command and guarantee a minimal common channel set 21 between end-devices and gateways of all networks. Other channels can be freely distributed 22 across the allowed frequency range on a network per network basis.

LoRaWAN Specification

1 8 Introduction to Class B

2 This section describes the LoRaWAN Class B layer which is optimized for battery-powered 3 end-devices that may be either mobile or mounted at a fixed location.

4 End-devices should implement Class B operation when there is a requirement to open 5 receive windows at fixed time intervals for the purpose of enabling server initiated downlink 6 messages.

7 LoRaWAN Class B option adds a synchronized reception window on the end-device.

8 One of the limitations of LoRaWAN Class A is the Aloha method of sending data from the 9 end-device; it does not allow for a known reaction time when the customer application or the 10 server wants to address the end-device. The purpose of Class B is to have an end-device 11 available for reception on a predictable time, in addition to the reception windows that 12 follows the random uplink transmission from the end-device of Class A. Class B is achieved 13 by having the gateway sending a beacon on a regular basis to synchronize the all the end14 devices in the network so that the end-device can opening a short extra reception window 15 (called ―ping slot‖) at a predictable time during a periodic time slot.

16

Note: The decision to switch from Class A to Class B comes from the

17

application layer of the end-device. If this class A to Class B switch

18

needs to be controlled from the network side, the customer application

19

must use one of the end-device‘s Class A uplinks to send back a

20

downlink to the application layer, and it needs the application layer on

21

the end-device to recognize this request – this process is not managed

22

at the LoRaWAN level.

LoRaWAN Specification

1 9 Principle of synchronous network initiated downlink (Class-B

2

option)

3 For a network to support end-devices of Class B, all gateways must synchronously 4 broadcast a beacon providing a timing reference to the end-devices. Based on this timing 5 reference the end-devices can periodically open receive windows, hereafter called ―ping 6 slots‖, which can be used by the network infrastructure to initiate a downlink communication. 7 A network initiated downlink using one of these ping slots is called a ―ping‖. The gateway 8 chosen to initiate this downlink communication is selected by the network server based on 9 the signal quality indicators of the last uplink of the end-device. For this reason, if an end10 device moves and detects a change in the identity advertised in the received beacon, it must 11 send an uplink to the network server so that the server can update the downlink routing path 12 database.

13 All end-devices start and join the network as end-devices of Class A. The end-device 14 application can then decide to switch to Class B. This is done through the following process:

15

 The end-device application requests the LoRaWAN layer to switch to Class B mode.

16

The LoRaWAN layer in the end-device searches for a beacon and returns either a

17

BEACON_LOCKED service primitive to the application if a network beacon was

18

found and locked or a BEACON_NOT_FOUND service primitive. To accelerate the

19

beacon discovery the LoRaWAN layer may use the ―BeaconTimingReq‖ message

20

described later.

21

 Based on the beacon strength and the battery life constraints, the end-device

22

application selects a ping slot data rate and periodicity, this is then requested them

23

from the end-device LoRaWAN layer.

24

 Once in Class B mode, the MAC layer sets to 1 the Class B bit of the FCTRL field of

25

every uplink frame transmitted. This bit signals to the server that the device has

26

switched to Class B. The MAC layer will autonomously schedule a reception slot for

27

each beacon and each ping slot. When the beacon reception is successful the end-

28

device LoRaWAN layer forwards the beacon content to the application together with

29

the measured radio signal strength. The end-device LoRaWAN layer takes into

30

account the maximum possible clock drift in the scheduling of the beacon reception

31

slot and ping slots. When a downlink is successfully demodulated during a ping slot,

32

it is processed similarly to a downlink as described in the LoRaWAN Class A

33

specification.

34

 A mobile end-device must periodically inform the network server of its location to

35

update the downlink route. This is done by transmitting a normal (possibly empty)

36

―unconfirmed‖ or ―confirmed‖ uplink. The end-device LoRaWAN layer will

37

appropriately set the Class B bit to 1. Optimally this can be done more efficiently if

38

the application detects that the node is moving by analyzing the beacon content. In

39

that case the end-device must apply a random delay (as defined in Section 15.5

40

between the beacon reception and the uplink transmission to avoid systematic uplink

41

collisions.

42

 If no beacon has been received for a given period (as defined in Section 12.2), the

43

synchronization with the network is lost. The MAC layer must inform the application

44

layer that it has switched back to Class A. As a consequence the end-device

45

LoRaWAN layer stops setting the Class B bit in all uplinks and this informs the

46

network server that the end-device is no longer in Class B mode. The end-device

47

application can try to switch back to Class B periodically. This will restart this process

48

starting with a beacon search.

4 In this example, given the beacon period is 128 s, the end-device also opens a ping 5 reception slot every 32 s. Most of the time this ping slot is not used by the server and 6 therefore the end-device reception window is closed as soon as the radio transceiver has 7 assessed that no preamble is present on the radio channel. If a preamble is detected the 8 radio transceiver will stay on until the downlink frame is demodulated. The MAC layer will 9 then process the frame, check that its address field matches the end-device address and 10 that the Message Integrity Check is valid before forwarding it to the application layer.

1 11 Downlink Ping frame format (Class B option)

2 11.1 Physical frame format
3 A downlink Ping uses the same format as a Class A downlink frame but might follow a 4 different channel frequency plan.

5 11.2 Unicast & Multicast MAC messages
6 Messages can be ―unicast‖ or ―multicast‖. Unicast messages are sent to a single end-device 7 and multicast messages are sent to multiple end-devices. All devices of a multicast group 8 must share the same multicast address and associated encryption keys. The LoRaWAN 9 Class B specification does not specify means to remotely setup such a multicast group or 10 securely distribute the required multicast key material. This must either be performed during 11 the node personalization or through the application layer.

12 11.2.1 Unicast MAC message format
13 The MAC payload of a unicast downlink Ping uses the format defined in the Class A 14 specification. It is processed by the end-device in exactly the same way. The same frame 15 counter is used and incremented whether the downlink uses a Class B ping slot or a Class A 16 ―piggy-back‖ slot.

17 11.2.2 Multicast MAC message format

18 The Multicast frames share most of the unicast frame format with a few exceptions:

19

 They are not allowed to carry MAC commands, neither in the FOpt field, nor in the

20

payload on port 0 because a multicast downlink does not have the same

21

authentication robustness as a unicast frame.

22

 The ACK and ADRACKReq bits must be zero. The MType field must carry the value

23

for Unconfirmed Data Down.

24

 The FPending bit indicates there is more multicast data to be sent. If it is set the

25

next multicast receive slot will carry a data frame. If it is not set the next slot may or

26

may not carry data. This bit can be used by end-devices to evaluate priorities for

27

conflicting reception slots.

LoRaWAN Specification

1 12 Beacon acquisition and tracking

2 Before switching from Class A to Class B, the end-device must first receive one of the 3 network beacons to align his internal timing reference with the network.

4 Once in Class B, the end-device must periodically search and receive a network beacon to 5 cancel any drift of its internal clock time base, relative to the network timing.

6 A Class B device may be temporarily unable to receive beacons (out of range from the 7 network gateways, presence of interference, ..). In this event, the end-device has to 8 gradually widen its beacon and ping slots reception windows to take into account a possible 9 drift of its internal clock.

10

Note: For example, a device which internal clock is defined with a +/-

11

10ppm precision may drift by +/-1.3mSec every beacon period.

12 12.1 Minimal beacon-less operation time

13 In the event of beacon loss, a device shall be capable of maintaining Class B operation for 2 14 hours (120 minutes) after it received the last beacon. This temporary Class B operation 15 without beacon is called ―beacon-less‖ operation. It relies on the end-device‘s own clock to 16 keep timing.

17 During beacon-less operation, unicast, multicast and beacon reception slots must all be 18 progressively expanded to accommodate the end-device‘s possible clock drift. 19

22 12.2 Extension of beacon-less operation upon reception
23 During this 120 minutes time interval the reception of any beacon directed to the end-device, 24 should extend the Class B beacon-less operation further by another 120 minutes as it allows 25 to correct any timing drift and reset the receive slots duration.
26 12.3 Minimizing timing drift
27 The end-devices may use the beacon‘s (when available) precise periodicity to calibrate their 28 internal clock and therefore reduce the initial clock frequency imprecision. As the timing 29 oscillator‘s exhibit a predictable temperature frequency shift, the use of a temperature 30 sensor could enable further minimization of the timing drift.

1 13 Class B Downlink slot timing
2 13.1 Definitions
3 To operate successfully in Class B the end-device must open reception slots at precise 4 instants relative to the infrastructure beacon. This section defines the required timing. 5 The interval between the start of two successive beacons is called the beacon period. The 6 beacon frame transmission is aligned with the beginning of the BEACON_RESERVED 7 interval. Each beacon is preceded by a guard time interval where no ping slot can be placed. 8 The length of the guard interval corresponds to the time on air of the longest allowed frame. 9 This is to insure that a downlink initiated during a ping slot just before the guard time will 10 always have time to complete without colliding with the beacon transmission. The usable 11 time interval for ping slot therefore spans from the end of the beacon reserved time interval 12 to the beginning of the next beacon guard interval.

16 The beacon frame time on air is actually much shorter than the beacon reserved time 17 interval to allow appending network management broadcast frames in the future.
18 The beacon window interval is divided into 212 = 4096 ping slots of 30 ms each numbered 19 from 0 to 4095.

20 An end-device using the slot number N must turn on its receiver exactly Ton seconds after

21 the start of the beacon where:

22

Ton = beacon_reserved + N * 30 ms

23 N is called the slot index.

24 The latest ping slot starts at beacon_reserved + 4095 * 30 ms = 124 970 ms after the 25 beacon start or 3030 ms before the beginning of the next beacon.

1 13.2 Slot randomization

2 To avoid systematic collisions or over-hearing problems the slot index is randomized and 3 changed at every beacon period.

4 The following parameters are used:

5 DevAddr pingNb

Device 32 bit network unicast or multicast address
Number of ping slots per beacon period. This must be a power of 2 integer: pingNb = 2k where 1 <= k <=7

pingPeriod

Period of the device receiver wake-up expressed in number of slots: pingPeriod = 212 / pingNb

pingOffset
beaconTime
slotLen 6

Randomized offset computed at each beacon period start. Values can range from 0 to (pingPeriod-1) The time carried in the field BCNPayload.Time of the immediately preceding beacon frame Length of a unit ping slot = 30 ms

7 At each beacon period the end-device and the server compute a new pseudo-random offset

8 to align the reception slots. An AES encryption with a fixed key of all zeros is used to

9 randomize:

10

Key = 16 x 0x00

11

Rand = aes128_encrypt(Key, beaconTime | DevAddr | pad16)

12

pingOffset = (Rand[0] + Rand[1]x 256) modulo pingPeriod

13 The slots used for this beacon period will be:

14

pingOffset + N x pingPeriod with N=[0:pingNb-1]

15 The node therefore opens receive slots starting at :

First slot

Beacon_reserved + pingOffset x slotLen

Slot 2

Beacon_reserved + (pingOffset + pingPeriod) x slotLen

Slot 3

Beacon_reserved + (pingOffset + 2 x pingPeriod) x slotLen

…

…

16 If the end-device serves simultaneously a unicast and one or more multicast slots this 17 computation is performed multiple times at the beginning of a new beacon period. Once for 18 the unicast address (the node network address) and once for each multicast group address.

19 In the case where a multicast ping slot and a unicast ping slot collide and cannot be served 20 by the end-device receiver then the end-device should preferentially listen to the multicast 21 slot. If there is a collision between multicast reception slots the FPending bit of the previous 22 multicast frame can be used to set a preference.

23 The randomization scheme prevents a systematic collision between unicast and multicast 24 slots. If collisions happen during a beacon period then it is unlikely to occur again during the 25 next beacon period.

15 The Frequency coding is identical to the NewChannelReq MAC command defined in the 16 Class A.

17 Frequency is a 24bits unsigned integer. The actual beacon channel frequency in Hz is 100 18 x frequ. This allows defining the beacon channel anywhere between 100 MHz to 1.67 GHz 19 by 100 Hz step. The end-device has to check that the frequency is actually allowed by its 20 radio hardware and return an error otherwise.

21 A valid non-zero Frequency will force the device to listen to the beacon on a fixed frequency 22 channel even if the default behavior specifies a frequency hopping beacon (i.e US ISM 23 band).

24 A value of 0 instructs the end-device to use the default beacon frequency plan as defined in 25 the ―Beacon physical layer‖ section. Where applicable the device resumes frequency 26 hopping beacon search.

5 Following the convention defined in the ―Physical layer‖ section of the Class A specification, 6 the ―Min data rate‖ subfield designates the lowest data rate allowed on this channel. For 7 example 0 designates DR0 / 125 kHz in the EU physical layer. Similarly ―Max data rate‖ 8 designates the highest data rate. For example in the EU spec, DrRange = 0x77 means that 9 only 50 kbps GFSK is allowed on a channel and DrRange = 0x50 means that DR0 / 125 kHz 10 to DR5 / 125 kHz are supported.

11 Upon reception of this command the end-device answers with a PingSlotFreqAns 12 message. The MAC payload of this message contains the following information:

16 14.4 BeaconTimingReq
17 This command is sent by the end-device to request the next beacon timing and channel. 18 This MAC command has no payload. The BeaconTimingReq & BeaconTimingAns 19 mechanism is only meant to accelerate the initial beacon search to lower the end-device 20 energy requirement.
21 The network may answer only a limited number of requests per a given time period. An end22 device must not expect that BeaconTimingReq is answered immediately with a 23 BeaconTimingAns. Class A end-devices wanting to switch to Class B should not transmit 24 more than one BeaconTimingReq per hour.
25 End-devices requiring a fast beacon lock must implement an autonomous beacon finding 26 algorithm.

15 The network common part contains a network identifier NetID to uniquely identify the 16 network for which the beacon is sent, and a timestamp Time in seconds since 00:00:00 17 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), 1 January 1970. The integrity of the beacon‘s network 18 common part is protected by an 8 or 16 bits CRC depending on PHY layer parameters. The 19 CRC-16 is computed on the NetID+Time fields as defined in the IEEE 802.15.4-2003 section 20 7.2.1.8. When an 8 bits CRC is required then the 8 LSBs of the computed CRC-16 are used.

21 For example: This is a valid EU868 beacon frame:

8 Listening and synchronizing to the network common part is sufficient to operate a stationary 9 end-device in Class B mode. A mobile end-device should also demodulate the gateway 10 specific part of the beacon to be able to signal to the network server whenever he is moving 11 from one cell to another.

12

Note: As mentioned before, all gateways send their beacon at exactly

13

the same point in time (i.e., time-synchronously) so that for network

14

common part there are no visible on-air collisions for a listening end-

15

device even if the end-device simultaneously receives beacons from

16

several gateways. With respect to the gateway specific part, collision

17

occurs but an end-device within the proximity of more than one

probability.

12 15.4 Beaconing precise timing

13 The beacon is sent every 128 seconds starting at 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time

14 (UTC), 1 January 1970 plus NwkID plus TBeaconDelay. Therefore the beacon is sent at

15

BT = k * 128 + NwkID + TBeaconDelay

16 seconds after 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), 1 January 1970

17 wherebyk is the smallest integer for which

18

k * 128 + NwkID>T

19 whereby

20

T = seconds since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), 1 January 1970.

21

Note: T is not (!) Unix time. Similar to GPS time and unlike Unix time,

22

T is strictly monotonically increasing and is not influenced by leap

23

seconds.

24 Whereby TBeaconDelay is a network specific delay in the [0:50] ms range.

25 TBeaconDelay may vary from one network to another and is meant to allow a slight

26 transmission delay of the gateways. TBeaconDelay must be the same for all gateways of a

27 given network. TBeaconDelay must be smaller than 50 ms. All end-devices ping slots use

28 the beacon transmission time as a timing reference, therefore the network server as to take

29 TBeaconDelay into account when scheduling the class B downlinks.

30

31 15.5 Network downlink route update requirements
32 When the network attempts to communicate with an end-device using a Class B downlink 33 slot, it transmits the downlink from the gateway which was closest to the end-device when 34 the last uplink was received. Therefore the network server needs to keep track of the rough 35 position of every Class B device.
36 Whenever a Class B device moves and changes cell, it needs to communicate with the 37 network server in order to update its downlink route. This update can be performed simply 38 by sending a ―confirmed‖ or ―unconfirmed‖ uplink, possibly without applicative payload.
39 The end-device has the choice between 2 basic strategies:

©2015 LoRa™ Alliance

Page 67 of 82

The authors reserve the right to change specifications without notice.

LoRaWAN Specification

1

 Systematic periodic uplink: simplest method that doesn‘t require demodulation of the

2

―gateway specific‖ field of the beacon. Only applicable to slowly moving or stationery

3

end-devices. There are no requirements on those periodic uplinks.

4

 Uplink on cell change: The end-device demodulates the ―gateway specific‖ field of

5

the beacon, detects that the ID of the gateway broadcasting the beacon it

6

demodulates has changed, and sends an uplink. In that case the device should

7

respect a pseudo random delay in the [0:120] seconds range between the beacon

8

demodulation and the uplink transmission. This is required to insure that the uplinks

9

of multiple Class B devices entering or leaving a cell during the same beacon period

10

will not systematically occur at the same time immediately after the beacon

11

broadcast.

12 Failure to report cell change will result in Class B downlink being temporary not operational. 13 The network server may have to wait for the next end-device uplink to transmit downlink 14 traffic. 15 16

2 16.1 EU 863-870MHz ISM Band
3 All unicast&multicastClass B downlinks use a single frequency channel defined by the 4 ―PingSlotChannelReq” MAC command. The default frequency is 869.525MHz

5 16.2 US 902-928MHz ISM Band
6 By default Class B downlinks use a channel function of the Time field of the last beacon (see 7 Beacon Frame content) and the DevAddr.

 Whereby Beacon_Time is the 32 bit Time field of the current beacon period

9

 Beacon_period is the length of the beacon period (defined as 128sec in the

10

specification)

11

 Floor designates rounding to the immediately lower integer value

12

 DevAddr is the 32 bits network address of the device

13 Class B downlinks therefore hop across 8 channels in the ISM band and all Class B end14 devices are equally spread amongst the 8 downlink channels.

15 If the ―PingSlotChannelReq” command with a valid non-zero argument is used to set the 16 Class B downlink frequency then all subsequent ping slots should be opened on this single 17 frequency independently of the last beacon frequency.

18 If the ―PingSlotChannelReq” command with a zero argument is sent, the end-device 19 should resume the default frequency plan, id Class B ping slots hoping across 8 channels.

20 The underlying idea is to allow network operators to configure end-devices to use a single 21 proprietary dedicated frequency band for the Class B downlinks if available, and to keep as 22 much frequency diversity as possible when the ISM band is used.

LoRaWAN Specification

1 17 Class C: Continuously listening end-device

2 The end-devices implanting the Class C option are used for applications that have sufficient 3 power available and thus do not need to minimize reception time.

4 Class C end-devices cannot implement Class B option.

5 The Class C end-device will listen with RX2 windows parameters as often as possible. The 6 end-device listens on RX2 when it is not either (a) sending or (b) receiving on RX1, 7 according to Class A definition. To do so, it will open a short window on RX2 parameters 8 between the end of the uplink transmission and the beginning of the RX1 reception window 9 and it will switch to RX2 reception parameters as soon as the RX1 reception window is 10 closed; the RX2 reception window will remain open until the end-device has to send another 11 message.

12

Note: There is not specific message for a node to tell the server that it

13

is a Class C node. It is up to the application on server side to know that

14

it manages Class C nodes based on the contract passed during the

15

join procedure.

16 17.1 Second receive window duration for Class C

17 Class C devices implement the same two receive windows as Class A devices, but they do 18 not close RX2 window until they need to send again. Therefore they may receive a downlink 19 in the RX2 window at nearly any time. A short listening window on RX2 frequency and data 20 rate is also opened between the end of the transmission and the beginning of the RX1 21 receive window.

24 17.2 Class C Multicast downlinks

25 Similarly to Class B, Class C devices may receive multicast downlink frames. The multicast 26 address and associated network session key and application session key must come from 27 the application layer. The same limitations apply for Class C multicast downlink frames:

28

 They are not allowed to carry MAC commands, neither in the FOpt field, nor in the

29

payload on port 0 because a multicast downlink does not have the same

30

authentication robustness as a unicast frame.

31

 The ACK and ADRACKReq bits must be zero. The MType field must carry the value

32

for Unconfirmed Data Down.

33

 The FPending bit indicates there is more multicast data to be sent. Given that a

34

Class C device keeps its receiver active most of the time, the FPending bit does not

35

trigger any specific behavior of the end-device.

8 9 Figure 15: Uplink timing diagram for confirmed data messages

10 The end-device first transmits a confirmed data frame containing the Data0 payload at an 11 arbitrary instant and on an arbitrary channel. The frame counter Cu is simply derived by 12 adding 1 to the previous uplink frame counter. The network receives the frame and 13 generates a downlink frame with the ACK bit set exactly RECEIVE_DELAY1 seconds later, 14 using the first receive window of the end-device. This downlink frame uses the same data 15 rate and the same channel as the Data0 uplink. The downlink frame counter Cd is also 16 derived by adding 1 to the last downlink towards that specific end-device. If there is no 17 downlink payload pending the network shall generate a frame without a payload. In this 18 example the frame carrying the ACK bit is not received.
19 If an end-point does not receive a frame with the ACK bit set in one of the two receive 20 windows immediately following the uplink transmission it may resend the same frame with 21 the same payload and frame counter again at least ACK_TIMEOUT seconds after the 22 second reception window. This resend must be done on another channel and must obey the 23 duty cycle limitation as any other normal transmission. If this time the network receives the 24 ACK downlink during its first receive window, as soon as the ACK frame is demodulated, the 25 end-device is free to transmit a new frame on a new channel.

1 2 Figure 16: Downlink timing diagram for confirmed data messages

3 The frame exchange is initiated by the end-device transmitting an ―unconfirmed‖ application 4 payload or any other frame on channel A. The network uses the downlink receive window to 5 transmit a ―confirmed‖ data frame towards the end-device on the same channel A. Upon 6 reception of this data frame requiring an acknowledgement, the end-device transmits a 7 frame with the ACK bit set at its own discretion. This frame might also contain piggybacked 8 data or MAC commands as its payload. This ACK uplink is treated like any standard uplink, 9 and as such is transmitted on a random channel that might be different from channel A.

10

Note: To allow the end-devices to be as simple as possible and have

11

keep as few states as possible it may transmit an explicit (possibly

12

empty) acknowledgement data message immediately after the

13

reception of a data message requiring an acknowledgment.

14

Alternatively the end-device may defer the transmission of an

15

acknowledgement to piggyback it with its next data message.

16 18.3 Downlink Timing for Frame-Pending Messages

17 The next diagram illustrates the use of the frame pending (FPending) bit on a downlink. 18 The FPending bit can only be set on a downlink frame and informs the end-device that the 19 network has several frames pending for him; the bit is ignored for all uplink frames.

20 If a frame with the FPending bit set requires an acknowledgement, the end-device shall do 21 so as described before. If no acknowledgment is required, the end-device may send an 22 empty data message to open additional receive windows at its own discretion, or wait until it 23 has some data to transmit itself and open receive windows as usual.

24

Note: The FPending bit is independent to the acknowledgment

scheme.

2 In this example the network has two confirmed data frames to transmit to the end-device. 3 The frame exchange is initiated by the end-device via a normal ―unconfirmed‖ uplink 4 message on channel A. The network uses the first receive window to transmit the Data0 with 5 the bit FPending set as a confirmed data message. The device acknowledges the reception 6 of the frame by transmitting back an empty frame with the ACK bit set on a new channel B. 7 RECEIVE_DELAY1 seconds later, the network transmits the second frame Data1 on 8 channel B, again using a confirmed data message but with the FPending bit cleared. The 9 end-device acknowledges on channel C.

12 In this example, the downlink frames are ―unconfirmed‖ frames, the end-device does not 13 need to send back and acknowledge. Receiving the Data0 unconfirmed frame with the 14 FPending bit set the end-device sends an empty data frame. This first uplink is not received 15 by the network. If no downlink is received during the two receive windows, the network has 16 to wait for the next spontaneous uplink of the end-device to retry the transfer. The end17 device can speed up the procedure by sending a new empty data frame.

18

Note: An acknowledgement is never sent twice.

19 The FPending bit, the ACK bit, and payload data can all be present in the same downlink. 20 For example, the following frame exchange is perfectly valid.

ACK {cu+3}

24 The end-device sends a ―confirmed data‖ uplink. The network can answer with a confirmed 25 downlink containing Data + ACK + ―Frame pending‖ then the exchange continues as 26 previously described.

LoRaWAN Specification

1 18.4 Data-Rate Adaptation during Message Retransmissions

2 When an end-device attempts the transmission of a ―confirmed‘ frame toward the network it 3 expects to receive an acknowledgement in one of the subsequent reception slot. In the 4 absence of the acknowledgement it will try to re-transmit the same data again. This re5 transmission happens on a new frequency channel, but can also happen at a different data 6 rate (preferable lower) than the previous one. It is strongly recommended to adopt the 7 following re-transmission strategy.

8 The first transmission of the ―confirmed‖ frame happens with a data rate DR.

10 The Data Rate max(a,b) stands for maximum of a and b values.

11 If after a recommended 8 transmissions, the frame has not been acknowledged the MAC 12 layer should return an error code to the application layer.

13

Note: For each re-transmission, the frequency channel is selected

14

randomly as for normal transmissions.

15 Any further transmission uses the last data rate used.

16 For example if an end-device sends a ―confirmed‖ frame first using DR5 and has to 17 retransmit 3 times (twice at DR5 then twice at DR4), the next frame transmitted will use DR4

18 Other example, if an end-device sends a ―confirmed‖ frame first using DR5 and does not 19 receive an acknowledge after 8 transmissions (2 at DR5, 2 at DR4, … , 2 at DR2), and the 20 application of this end-device re-initiates a ―confirmed‖ transmission a little later, the first two 21 transmission will be tentatively at DR2, then switch to DR1, then to DR0.

LoRaWAN Specification

1 19 Recommendation on contract to be provided to the network

2

server by the end-device provider at the time of provisioning

3 Configuration data related to the end-device and its characteristics must be known by the 4 network server at the time of provisioning. –This provisioned data is called the ―contract‖. 5 This contract cannot be provided by the end-device and must be supplied by the end-device 6 provider using another channel (out-of-band communication).

7 This end-device contract is stored in the network server. It can be used by the application 8 server and the network controller to adapt the algorithms.

9 This data will include:

10

 End-device specific radio parameters (device frequency range, device maximal

11

output power, device communication settings - RECEIVE_DELAY1,

12

RECEIVE_DELAY2)

13

 Application type (Alarm, Metering, Asset Tracking, Supervision, Network Control)

LoRaWAN Specification

1 20 Recommendation on finding the locally used channels

2 End-devices that can be activated in territories that are using different frequencies for 3 LoRaWAN will have to identify what frequencies are supported for join message at their 4 current location before they send any message. The following methods are proposed:

5

 A GPS enabled end-device can use its GPS location to identify which frequency

6

band to use.

7

 End-device can search for a beacon and use its frequency to identify its region

8

 End-device can search for a beacon and if this one is sending the antenna GPS

9

coordinate, it can use this to identify its region

10

 End-device can search for a beacon and if this one is sending a list of join

11

frequencies, it can use this to send its join message
