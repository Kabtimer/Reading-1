Increasing range?
q Generally, robustness and sensitivity can be increased when transmitting much slower
q A Sigfox message is sent relatively slowly in an ultra narrow band of spectrum. Max throughput=~100bps
q LoRa also increases time-on-air when maximum range is needed. But LoRa uses spread spectrum approach. Throughput=~300bps-37500bps

The generic hardware platform

The Arduino Pro Mini
The Arduino Pro Mini is a compact form factor Arduino board based on the ATmega328P microcontroller Use the 3.3v and 8MHz version of the Arduino Pro Mini for lower power consumption

You can get the original board designed by Sparkfun or get one of the various clones available mainly from Chinese manufacturer. The last solution is very cost-effective as the Pro Mini board can be purchased for a bit more than 1€ a piece.

Depending on how many sensors you want to connect, the number of ground (GND) pins may be limited. You can extend a GND pin with a header pin where all pins are soldered together.

The LoRa radio module

There are various LoRa radio modules that are all based on the Semtech SX1272/1276 chips family

Fully tested LoRa

Write your own cloud script
q Use our templates to write your own cloud script q A cloud script is called with 5 arguments
These parameters are passed to the script. It is up to the cloud script to use these parameters or not.
57

Ex: Node-Red
q Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services, e.g. clouds of various types
q provides a browser-based flow editor to wire together flows with a wide range of nodes
58

CloudNodeRed.py
q CloudNodeRed.py shows how interface with Node-Red can be simply implemented to benefit from the facility offered by Node-Red
q 3 variables will be used by CloudNodeRed.py
q project_name="waziup" q organization_name="UPPA" q sensor_name="Sensor"
q when a device which address is 2 sends "TC/21.65/HU/85" to the gateway, CloudNodeRed.py will generate the following json entries in nodered/nodered.txt file
q {"source":"waziup/UPPA/Sensor2","measure":"TC","value":21.65} q {"source":"waziup/UPPA/Sensor2","measure":"HU","value":85}
59

Adding MQTT
q An MQTT node using the test.mosquitto.org broker will receive the messages with the topic defined as waziup/UPPA/Sensor2/TC and waziup/UPPA/Sensor2/HU
q It will then respectively publish 21.65 and 85 under these topics
q More information on:
q https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw/blob/master /gw_full_latest/README-NodeRed.md
60

The Node-red enabled gateway
q Messages received on the gateway can be injected into a Node-Red flow, allowing complex data processing to be defined
21.65
61

Another example with CloudGpsFile.py
q CloudGpsFile.py is a dedicated "cloud" module that will search in incoming messages a valid 'LAT' and 'LGT' field such as in "BC/9/LAT/43.31402/LGT/-0.36370/FXT/4180"
q You can enable CloudGpsFile.py in clouds.json. When a message with valid GPS coordinates is received, CloudGpsFile.py will write an entry in gps/gps.txt file containing relevant packet and GPS information, including the distance (in km) between the gateway and the GPS device
src waziup_UPPA_Sensor15 seq 188 bc 9 snr 5 rssi -90 time 2017-11-20T14:18:54 gw 00000027EB5171F7 fxt 4180 lat 43.31402 lgt -0.36370 distance 0.0224
q For distance calculation, the gateway position MUST be provided in the gateway_conf.json file (see Annex)
q For range test campaign, you can import (or copy/paste) this file in an Excel sheet to plot distance against SNR/RSSI
62

Maintaining a list of GPS devices (1)
q CloudGpsFile.py also maintains a list of GPS devices in gps/gps.json
{ "devices": [ { "gw": "00000027EB5171F7", "src": "waziup_UPPA_Sensor15", "seq": 188, "distance": 0.0224, "fxt": 4180, "bc": 9, "lat": 43.31402, "snr": 8, "time": "2017-11-20T14:18:54", "active": "yes", "rssi": -45, "lgt": -0.3637 } ]
}
q New devices (from src field) will be added, while existing devices will be updated
63

Maintaining a list of GPS devices (2)
q CloudGpsFile.py also extract from the list of GPS devices those that have sent GPS information in during the last time window
q key_GpsFile.py defines
q active_interval_minutes=20 q For instance, devices that have sent GPS info in the last
20 minutes will be indicated as active
q Those active devices are further maintained in gps/active_gps.json
q Further versions can also create kml or gpx file or any combination that would allow more complex visualization features
64

A web interface for tracking GPS devices
q A web interface could use gps/gps.json and gps/active_gps.json to show:
q the last updated GPS device q active devices (in the last time window) q inactive devices that have not been updated in the
last time window
q Especially usefull in mobility scenario
65

Extending by adding a new periodic task
q Illustration with dynamic gateway GPS position q The gateway's coordinates are stored in
gateway_conf.json
"gateway_conf" : { "gateway_ID" : "000000XXXXXXXXXX", "ref_latitude" : "43.31416", "ref_longitude" : "-0.36430",
q In a mobility scenario, the position of the gateway can be updated
q post_status_processing_gw.py which is periodically called by the main post-processing loop can be extended to get the position of the gateway using a connected GPS module.
66

When enabling dynamic_gps
q Enabling dynamic_gps in gateway_conf.json activates the following tasks
q post_status_processing_gw.py which is periodically called by post_processing_gw.py will try to get the position of the gateway using a connected GPS module. It uses get_gps.py in the sensors_in_raspi folder
q get_gps.py produces a gateway_gps.txt file if a valid GPS fix is obtained. The file simply contains the coordinates in decimal degree: 43.31427,-0.36424
q If post_status_processing_gw.py finds a gateway_gps.txt file, it will update in gateway_conf.json the GPS coordinate fields used by CloudGpsFile.py
67

Now, IoT becomes reality!

Low-cost LoRa IoT devices and gateway FAQ

1) What is Internet-of-Thing (IoT)?

From IERC (European Research Cluster on the Internet of Thing)
The IERC definition states that IoT is "A dynamic global network infrastructure with self-configuring capabilities based on standard and interoperable communication protocols where physical and virtual “things” have identities, physical attributes, and virtual personalities and use intelligent interfaces, and are seamlessly integrated into the information network."
From http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/internet-of-things/

Tutorial on hardware &
software for low-cost longrange IoT!

"The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects that contain embedded technology to communicate and sense or interact with their internal states or the external environment."

From http://internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com/definition/Internet-of-Things-IoT

"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction."

2) What is WAZIUP?

The EU H2020 WAZIUP project, namely the Open Innovation Platform for IoT-Big Data in Sub-Saharan Africa is a collaborative research project using cutting edge technology applying IoT and Big Data to improve the working conditions in the rural ecosystem of Sub-Saharan Africa. First, WAZIUP operates by involving farmers and breeders in order to define the platform specifications in focused validation cases. Second, while tackling challenges which are specific to the rural ecosystem, it also engages the flourishing ICT ecosystem in those countries by fostering new tools and good practices, entrepreneurship and start-ups. Aimed at boosting the ICT sector, WAZIUP proposes solutions aiming at long term sustainability.

The RFM95W can be found assembled (Adafruit) or an adapter can be purchased (from Ideetron for instance)

GND

Connect the corresponding SPI pins of the radio

module to the SPI pins on the Pro Mini board. MOSI

(blue) is pin 11, MISO (green) is pin 12, CS (white) is

pin 10 and CLK (orange) is pin 13 (right picture).

Then connect also the VCC (red) and the GND (black)

of the radio module to the VCC and the GND of the

board (right picture). The VCC of the Pro Mini board

gets 3.3v from the on-board voltage regulator.
