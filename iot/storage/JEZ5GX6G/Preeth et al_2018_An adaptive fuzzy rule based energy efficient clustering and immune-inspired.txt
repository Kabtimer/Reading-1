Abstract Energy efficiency is a significant problem in wireless sensor networks. Sensor networks are battery powered, therefore become a dead after certain period of time. In clustering technique, the cluster head selection is an essential issue. To moderate all above problems, this paper introduced adaptive fuzzy rule based energy efficient clustering and immune-inspired routing (FEEC-IIR) protocol for WSN assisted IoT system. For an optimal cluster head selection, adaptive fuzzy multi-criteria decision making approach (AF-MCDM) is used which is a combination of fuzzy AHP and TOPSIS method is introduced an energy efficient clustering algorithm. The criteria of energy status, QoS impact and node location are taken as the main factors that can influence the selection of cluster heads while each criteria contains some sub-criteria. For routing, immune-inspired optimization algorithm is used to enhance the data delivery reliability. The cluster based routing is an efficient manner to reduce the energy consumption. The experimental results show that our introduced approach improves the QoS parameters such as packet delivery ratio, packet loss ratio, throughput, network lifetime, end to end delay, channel load, jitter, bit error rate (BER), buffer occupancy and energy consumption compared with existing clustering and routing approach.

Wireless sensor network is a combination of wireless networks which is combined in a distended combination of distributed autonomous device. The special autonomous device using the sensor to rectify the physical and environmental conditions. In the entire level of network connection, WSN provide the suitable role in the development of network lifetime. WSN are fabulous over the stream of network which randomly contribute the incorporates network connectivity among the gateway distributed in the node (Hong et al. 2018).

monitoring correspondingly (Hosen et al. 2018). By decreasing the wiring costs and allowing new sorts of estimation applications, the remote system can enhancement the wired structures. Remote monitoring covers variety of uses. One of three kinds of system topologies collected in WSN hubs. Every hub interfaces particularly to a passage in the star topology (Khan et al. 2018) (Moh’d Alia et al. 2018). In a group of network, tree arranges in the form of every hub interfaces with a hub higher in the tree to the door. The information is steered from the most minimal hub on the tree to the portal (Mostafa et al. 2018). Finally, the work systems highlight hubs can interface with various hubs to provide the extended unwavering quality in the network. The WSN are contained of multiple connection components additive with the wireless network. The connection network modified in the network node will established with several components for example battery, analog circuit, sensor interfaces radio, microcontroller and so on (Kuo et al. 2018).
In early years, the Internet is relocating to stimulate the new thought about the IoT from interfacing individuals to associating things. This new pattern brings articles or things into the Internet and offers new applications and business (Farman et al. 2018) (Mahajan et al. 2016). From indoor

wearable appliances to outside natural sensors, that things are running and turn out to be fresh sources that producing information on the internet. Making the elements on the Internet is more conscious to the present reality. IoT is a promising inquire with an emerging modern pattern. Different methodologies are available to bring things into the internet. In IoT, Clustering and routing are two techniques to enhance the energy efficiency of WSNs. It may arise the NP-hard problem (Khalil et al. 2014) (Li et al. 2018). In remote network history, the energy efficient design of corresponding resolution is an extraordinary interested problem of WSNs without a point of reference (AlSkaif et al. 2017). The transceiver evacuates significantly more present out of the battery than the microchip latent state or the sensors and the memory chip when a node is in transmit mode. The ratio of the energy is mandatory for transmitting and a bit of data is usually supposed to be considerably larger than one for preparation (Sheng et al. 2018) (Ai et al. 2018). By typical energy proficiency, the correspondence resolutions should be composed, while for preparing errands, this imperative is less prohibitive (Wang et al. 2016). When handling information inside the hub, the writing on WSNs manages the summary of vitality proficient conventions, terminating the part of the vitality devoured. The handset is the part in charge of the usage of common energy (Zeng et al. 2017). The information preparing in WSNs may want expending undertakings to be performed at the microchip, it should be longer than the real time span a handset that spends more time in transmit mode. Therefore, the common rule correspondence convention configuration is suggestively more dangerous than that of the processing task scheduling it doesn’t attain a true value (Gupta et al. 2018).
In every case, WSN base station needs to produce an aggregated value to the end clients. By reducing the transmission overhead and the vitality utilization, the accumulation of the information to be sent (Ramachandran et al. 2018). The hubs can be suitable in the little gatherings to support the data gathering termed as clusters. In data collection, clustering can be considered as the separation of the hubs on the principle of the system. So clustering has been fascinated to improve the lifetime of network. The significant metrics for evaluating the execution of a sensor arranges. To achieve the flexibility of the organized system and the vitality productivity grouping is done (Xu et al. 2016) (Aadri et al. 2017). Based on their borders improvement of the group furthermore includes the assigning the part to the hub. The Cluster Head (CH) is known as the charge of the conglomeration, handling and transmission of the information to the base station in organizer of group. Through the substitute hubs which are in responsibility of detecting and sending the gathered information to the CH is known as the Member Nodes (Singh et al. 2018).

IoT is a one of the well growing technologies which can be utilized in many features of our life. To observe the ambient environment, large density of devices with sensing capacity are placed in IoT system. Each device requires to transmit the collected data to base station which may lead to unwanted redundancy due to content similarity. This may additionally lead to the network congestion and bandwidth waste. By using battery with restricted resource, the small smart devices or sensors are powered which is critical to replace or charge. In IoT, the huge number of smart devices and the ubiquitous connection demands cause the energy hole issue. To prevent trouble and prolong the lifetime of the network, the efficient energy utilization is broadly considered.
Clustering and multi-hop routing is the common approach to improve energy efficiency of the network. Instead of letting each node in the network forward its own information to the base station directly, they are grouped into different clusters. Based on some criteria, a cluster head (CH) node is selected in each cluster. The CH node will gather information from other cluster member nodes and then forward the processed information to base station via multiple hops using other CH nodes. The benefit of such scheme is twofold. First, the CH node can compress the data collected from cluster member nodes to reduce unwanted redundancy. Second, the energy efficiency is greatly improved by letting most nodes in the network transmit to a nearby CH node, and limiting the multiple hop communication to CH nodes only.
The main contribution of the paper are as follows: We propose an energy efficient scheme based adaptive fuzzy multi criteria decision making (AF-MCDM) approach, which fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and TOPSIS methods are combined together for selection of cluster head. To enhance the data delivery reliability, the immuneinspired optimization algorithm is used for routing. This paper is organized as follow: Sect. 2 describe the related works. The introduced methodology is explained in Sect. 3. The experimental results are given in Sect. 4. Finally, the Sect. 5 includes the conclusion and future scope.

Shen et al. (2017) have described an Efficient Centroidbased Routing Protocol for Energy Management in WSNAssisted IoT to upgrade the execution of the framework. The introduced EECRP consolidates three key parts, for example, new dispersed bunch development strategy that enables the self-association of nearby hubs, another course of action of computations for modifying groups (Park et al. 2018) and turning the group head in light of the centroid position to impartially suitable the energy stack among all

sensor nodes, and another framework to diminish the vitality utilization for long-remove correspondences. In particular, the lingering vitality of hubs is considered in EECRP for processing the centroid0 s position. Definitively, the simulation results demonstrate that EECRP performs better than anything LEACH, LEACH-C, and GEEC. In addition, EECRP is proper for frameworks that require a long lifetime and whose base station (BS) is situated in the system.
The earlier TCBDGA and HEED systems were distributed and centralized clustering algorithm individually, the two of which accomplished energy balance by rotating the CH nodes occasionally. In any case, they required CH nodes to speak with base station straightforwardly rather than through multi-hop, accordingly the CH nodes a long way from base station may exhaust their energy early. In addition, in routing energy efficiency accomplished by changing the quantity of clusters as indicated by the separation to base station progressively. However, the number and area of CH nodes can’t be ensured which may prompt an energyconsuming routing process. Be that as it may, the above said methods did not accomplish reasonable cluster formation and routing which may lead to traffic overload in large-scale networks (Sridhar et al. 2018).

In the applications of WSN, energy efficiency is a vital problem. By using clustering with data aggregation is an essential way to enhance the energy efficiency via software based protocols. This paper proposes a FEEC-IIR protocol that improves the Quality of service and lessens the overall energy consumption. Initially, we considered that WSN contains number of heterogeneous nodes. Each and every node have the different levels of nodal energy. Additionally, all sensor nodes have restricted battery life and they are not rechargeable. The nodes have the ability to combine all the redundant information which in turn, saves the energy. The overall introduced methodology is mentioned in Fig. 1.
In the clustering algorithm, the cluster head selection is the main problem. To solve the above problem, we presented a multi criteria decision making process. In this paper, an adaptive fuzzy multi-criteria decision making approach (AF-MCDM) is utilized in which fuzzy AHP and TOPSIS methods are combined together for cluster head selection of the optimal decision making to develop a distributed energy efficient clustering algorithm. To achieve data delivery reliability immune-inspired optimization algorithmis employed to increase the data delivery reliability, two objectives need to be considered simultaneously:

• Minimize the cost of the intra-cluster communication. • Minimize the cost of the inter-cluster communication.
The total cost of the links between all the cluster members and their correspondent CHs is called as the intra-cluster communication cost. The total cost of the constructed tree, the inter-cluster communication cost, is defined as the sum of the costs of the links between the CHs forming that tree.
The introduced system will be implemented in MATLAB platform. The performance is evaluated and compared with earlier clustering and routing scheme with respect to Quality of service parameters such as packet delivery ratio, packet loss ratio, throughput, network lifetime, end to end delay, channel load, jitter, bit error rate (BER), buffer occupancy and energy consumption.

In the energy consumption, the cluster formation plays a

significant part. This paper using the k-means clustering

algorithm for cluster formation. The number of data sets

are divided into k clusters (Shakeel et al. 2018) by using

this algorithm. The value of k is estimated as following

expression.

3.3.2 Communication cost between a node and its neighbors

This paper proposes an adaptive fuzzy multi criteria decision making technique in which fuzzy AHP and TOPSIS methods are combined together for optimal cluster head selection. In this process, three criteria and six sub-criteria are considered which is directly stimulus the network lifetime. The fuzzy AHP is applied to discover the weights of each criteria and the TOPSIS method is used to rank the alternatives. The three criteria are energy status, QoS impact and node location. Six sub-criteria are residual energy, communication cost between a node and its neighbors, link quality, restart number and number of neighbors, node marginality, respectively. Several criteria are explained in Fig. 2.

3.3.1 Residual energy

The energy is the most important resource which considered in wireless sensor networks. Cluster heads are nodes consume more energy than cluster members when they include in aggregating, processing and routing data. The residual energy is computed as following expression.

Er = E0 − Ec

(3)

The transmitting message is consumed energy which is directly proportional to the square of the distance amongst the candidate nodes and the source node. The value of communication cost is defined as follows:

C = da2vg , d02

(4)

Where davg represents the average distance between the node and the neighbors and d0 is the broadcasting radius of the node.

3.3.3 Link quality

In wireless sensor network, the fading channel is typically random and time-variant. Once the receiver has not analyzed signal correctly the re-transmission will occur. Re-transmission requires additional energy dissipation of the transmitter. So the link quality must be assessed to accomplish energy efficiency. The link quality is calculated through following expression.

Q = Qi − Qmin , Qmax − Qmin

(5)

where the Qmaxand Qmin are the maximum and minimum number of re-transmission from the neighborhood, respectively; and Qi denotes the total re-transmission number between the neighbors and the node.

3.3.4 Restart number

The node is actually an embedded system. Sometimes, the system has to be affect a software or hardware malfunction. To solve this problem, the watchdog circuit is utilized to restart the PC system in order to guarantee the node to continue working. Therefore, the frequent restart can consume some extra energy. The value of restart number is evaluated using below expression.

S = 1 − S0 − Smin , Smax − Smin

(6)

where the Smax and Sminare the maximum and minimum restart number received from neighbors, respectively; and S0 denotes the total restart number after the sensor network has been deployed.

3.3.6 Node marginality

The part of coverage region would have no sensor nodesif a node locates at the edge of the monitoring area. The node only covers a restricted region.So the total number of CHs in the network will increase. The node marginality is defined as follows:

3.5 Immune‑inspired optimization algorithm
The artificial immune algorithm is a combination of antigen and antibody reaction of the immune system. This is a population based algorithm. Human immune system inspired the artificial immune algorithm which is a highly developed, analogous and distributed adaptive systems. In this case, antigen is equivalent to the objective function while the antibody is corresponding to the feasible solution of the problem. The algorithm is explained in Fig. 3 and step by step process are illustrated as follows.
Step 1: Recognition of antigens
The objective function and constraints are taken as the input data.
Step 2: Production of antibodies
Initially, antibodies are randomly created to form the population. Each antibody contains some binary bits according to number of unknown variables.
Step 3: Population evaluation
Antigens represent the value of objective function. By minimizing the objective function, affinity of each antibody are computed in the population.

Step 4: Antibodies selection
Antibodies with the higher fitness value will be selected as the parent antibodies to form the population. Depend on the probability of each antibody, the best parents are selected. The designated parents are directly proportional to the fitness value.These antibodies will undergo the replication and the clonal proliferation processes for fabricating offspring antibodies.
Step 5: Replication process
Replication operation is used to choose the best pr . Based on the replication rate, ps CHs antibodies from pop_sel to build pop_rep . These antibodies will undergo the mutation process to create offspring.
Step 6: Clonal proliferation within Hyper mutation
Clonal proliferation is applied to the selected parent antibodies to improve their diversity. This operation is used to make the parent antibodies proliferate and produce several clones. Based on the clonal rate, antibodies are chosen from pop_sel to join the hyper mutation process. Based on the hyper mutation rate, antibodies are form pop_hyper through producing number of clones for each antibody.
Step 7: Mutation process
The mutation operation is used to mutate the generated antibodies from pop_rep and pop_hyper to produce offspring population.
Step 8: Population updating
Based on fitness values, the best antibodies are selected from the initial population and offspring population to form the population of the next generation.

In this paper, an adaptive fuzzy based energy efficient clustering and immune-inspired routing protocol (FEEC-IIR) for wireless sensor network assisted IoT system has been introduced. An adaptive fuzzy multi criteria decision making (AF-MCDM) approach has been introduced in which cluster head selected from the suitable nodes on the basis of important criteria of energy status, QoS impact and node location while each criteria contains some sub-criteria. Moreover, the cluster head selection scheme can reduce the traffic and save energy. Lastly, the immune-inspired optimization algorithm is employed for routing. Minimize the cost of the inter and intra cluster communication is two objectives that are considered in this algorithm to achieve the data reliability. The MATLAB software tool is used for simulation purpose and the data has been collected from real time data transmission scenario. The performance results are plotted regarding QoS parameters such as packet delivery ratio (99%), packet loss ratio, throughput (0.95Mbps), network lifetime (5500rounds), end to end delay, channel load, jitter, bit error rate (BER), buffer occupancy and energy consumption (45 mJ) when compared to existing routing protocols. In future, finding the optimal route with high residual energy for multi-hop inter-cluster communication, placing the several base stations to decrease the load on cluster heads close to a single base stations to improvement in energy efficiency and overall lifetime of network in WSN.
