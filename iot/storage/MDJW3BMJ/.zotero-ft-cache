Connecting to a cloud platform
UBIDOTS Platform ➢ You should subscribe to your things.ubidots.com platform ➢ Version Education https://ubidots.com/education/ ➢ You can follow these two tutorials :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynhJ4YhhQEM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3DVe7TLvdI ➢ The objective is to demonstrate the basic functionality of Contiki’s Ubidots library
➢How to use the library to POST to a variable ➢How to use the library to POST to a collection ➢How to receive (parts of) the HTTP reply

Connecting to a cloud platform
Example of an application with Ubidots
➢ Use miredo package to allow full ipv6 connectivity to your host $ sudo apt-get install miredo
➢ You can test if your interface is configured with an ipv6 address http://test-ipv6.com/
➢ If the IPv6 cannot be used in the school network so try to use your 3G, 4G networks
➢ Check if you can do ipv6 ping $ ping6 ipv6.google.com

We can see the obtained local ipv6 address

Connecting to a cloud platform
Example of an application with Ubidots
➢ Ubidots uses TCP sockets to connect to the host things.ubidots.com. You can get the IPv6 address of ubidots platform from https://centralops.net/co/
IPv6 of ubidots server is: 2607:f0d0:2101:39::2

Connecting to a cloud platform
Example of an application with Ubidots
➢This application has been developed by G. Oikonomou (https://github.com/goikonomou/contiki/tree/ubidots-demo)
➢The source code of the /contiki/examples/ipv6/ubidots is ubidots-demo.c ➢Before compilation check if you have the folder in /contiki/app/ubidots
sudo make ubidots-demo.upload TARGET=zoul

Check if you have the following instruction in your project-conf.h
#define UBIDOTS_CONF_REMOTE_HOST "2607:f0d0:2101:39::2"
IPv6 of ubidots server The Ubidots demo posts every 30 seconds the zoul mote’s uptime and sequence number, so we need to create these two variables at Ubidots. Login or subscribe for an ubidots account. The most important information to keep confidential is the API Key.

Connecting to a cloud platform
Example of an application with Ubidots
➢ Copy/Past the API key of your Ubidots API. It defines the value of the parameter UBIDOTS_CONF_AUTH_TOKEN in project-conf.h

➢ Copy the Variables IDs which correspond to

#define UBIDOTS_DEMO_CONF_UPTIME

“"

#define UBIDOTS_DEMO_CONF_SEQUENCE

“”

Of course, you add these variables in your project-conf.h

Example of an application with Ubidots
➢ Check if your Makefile looks like the following screenshot:
➢ Compile the project

Connecting to a cloud platform
Example of an application with Ubidots ➢ Compile and program a Border Router device as shown in the previous Labs. ➢ Verify the Border Router is online by making a ping6 request to it. ➢ Browse the Border Router’s web service and also ping6 the ubidots-demo node

Connecting to a cloud platform
Example of an application with Ubidots
➢ After fixing the missing in your source code, you should obtain the following information after pushing the reset button.

➢ If you are able to exchange real-world data with your network, you should obtain these curves.
➢ If you have problems to obtain such results see the following WIKI, Section Hands on: connecting to a real world IoT platform (HTTP-based)
https://github.com/marcozennaro/IPv6-WSN-book/blob/master/5.asc#hands-onconnecting-to-a-real-world-iot-platform-http-based

Connecting to a cloud platform
➢ It is possible to use python middleware to push/pull data to/from could platform:

The End… Thank you so much
