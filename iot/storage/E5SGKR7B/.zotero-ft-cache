Abstract—In this paper, a dynamic radio resource slicing framework is presented for a two-tier heterogeneous wireless network (HetNet). Through software-deﬁned networking (SDN)enabled wireless network function virtualization (NFV), radio spectrum resources of heterogeneous wireless networks are partitioned into different bandwidth slices for different base stations (BSs). This framework facilitates spectrum sharing among heterogeneous BSs and achieves differentiated quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning for data service and machine-to-machine (M2M) service in the presence of network load dynamics. To determine the set of optimal bandwidth slicing ratios and optimal BS-device association patterns, a network utility maximization problem is formulated with the consideration of different trafﬁc statistics and QoS requirements, location distribution for end devices, varying device locations, load conditions in each cell, and inter-cell interference. For tractability, the optimization problem is transformed to a biconcave maximization problem. An alternative concave search (ACS) algorithm is then designed to solve for a set of partial optimal solutions. Simulation results verify the convergence property and display low complexity of the ACS algorithm. It is demonstrated that the proposed radio resource slicing framework outperforms the two other resource slicing schemes in terms of low communication overhead, high spectrum utilization, and high aggregate network utility.

I. INTRODUCTION
The ﬁfth generation (5G) wireless networks are envisioned to interconnect a massive number of miscellaneous end devices (e.g., smartphones, remote monitoring sensors, and home appliances) generating both mobile broadband data and machineto-machine (M2M) services/applications (e.g., video conferencing, remote monitoring, and smart homing), to realize the ubiquitous Internet-of-Things (IoT) architecture [1]–[3]. However, the distinctive features of 5G wireless networks, with inherent radio spectrum scarcity, pose technical challenges on the evolving inter-networking paradigm. First, efﬁcient spectrum exploitation is required in response to a surge in network trafﬁc volume and densiﬁcation of end devices (especially machine-type devices).

of network load is a pivotal and challenging research issue. Multi-tier cell deployment (i.e., a macro-cell underlaid by several tiers of small-cells) is a potential solution to improve the spectrum efﬁciency, by exploring spatial multiplexing on currently employed spectrum [4]; Moreover, the heterogeneity of both service type and device type necessitates the exploration of unlicensed bands and underutilized spectrum through different wireless access technologies [5]. For example, longterm evolution (LTE) devices can utilize WiFi unlicensed bands to support delay-insensitive services [5].
However, spectrum exploitations face technical challenges. In a hierarchical multi-tier network architecture, physical base stations (BSs), i.e., macro-cell and small-cell BSs (MBSs and SBSs), are mostly owned by different infrastructure providers (InPs) [6], and radio resources are often preallocated at each BS [4]. Spectrum sharing among MBSs and SBSs are limited, due to distributed communication overhead and regulations on heterogeneous InPs [7]. Therefore, to improve the spectrum efﬁciency and boost network capacity, more and more SBSs are deployed underlaying the MBSs, which substantially increases capital and operational expenses (CapEx and OpEx) on network infrastructures [6], [7] and, at the same time, raises the inter-cell interference level.
Hence, to facilitate spectrum sharing among heterogeneous infrastructures without adding more network deployment cost, network function virtualization (NFV) becomes a promising solution [8], [9]. NFV is a newly-emerging approach originally used in core networks in the Internet, where a set of network/service functions (e.g., ﬁrewalls, load balancing, wide area network (WAN) optimizers) are decoupled from the physical hardware and run as software instances in virtual machines [9], [10]. This decoupling of service plane and physical plane removes the heterogeneity of physical infrastructures and facilitates service customization in a softwareoriented way. In the wireless domain, network functions in each BS are a composition of radio access and processing functions for establishing wireless connections and allocating radio resources for each associated end device. In wireless NFV, radio access and processing functions run as software instances in heterogeneous BSs (MBSs and SBSs) [11] and are managed by a central controller [7], [12]. Note that the central controller is software deﬁned networking (SDN) enabled [12], [13], which has direct control (programmability) on all BSs and the associated radio resources [14]. With SDN-enabled function softwarization, radio resources of heterogeneous BSs can be reallocated by the central controller to improve the overall resource utilization. This process is referred to as radio

resource slicing [15]. Radio resource slicing in the SDN-based wireless NFV
framework have three major beneﬁts: (1) Spectrum sharing among heterogeneous wireless infrastructures is achieved in a software-oriented way instead of physically deploying more SBSs with increased CapEx and OpEx; (2) The central controller has global information over the physical network, which facilitates the resource sharing without distributed information exchange; (3) The coexistence of heterogeneous services requires QoS isolation1 among different groups of end devices belonging to different service types. Resource slicing is a promising approach to achieve the QoS isolation by creating resource slices for different service groups.
Most existing radio resource slicing schemes focus on the device level, to allocate a ﬁxed amount of radio resources of a BS to different device groups in the BS coverage. However, the network-level resource sharing and resource slicing among heterogeneous BSs need further studies. As a matter of fact, an essence of network function virtualization is to enable radio resource abstraction for the purpose of managing the resources among heterogeneous wireless networks. A few studies address spectrum-level resource sharing among LTE BSs without explicitly differentiating trafﬁc statistics and QoS descriptions among diversiﬁed services (i.e., mobile broadband data service and M2M service) [18], [19]. Therefore, to satisfy differentiated QoS requirements from heterogeneous services, trafﬁc statistics for each speciﬁc type of service should be modeled and considered in the resource slicing. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive radio bandwidth slicing framework for a two-tier heterogeneous wireless network (HetNet) to facilitate spectrum sharing among BSs and achieve QoS isolation for different service types. The contributions of this paper are three-folded:
1) We consider the coexistence of machine-type devices (MTDs) and mobile user devices (MUs), supporting M2M service and data service, respectively. An optimization framework for spectrum bandwidth slicing is developed to maximize the aggregate network utility, with the consideration of location distribution for MTDs and MUs, trafﬁc statistics and differentiated QoS demands, trafﬁc load in each cell, varying distances between BSs and devices, and inter-cell interference. The outputs of the optimization problem are BS-device association patterns and optimal bandwidth slicing ratios;
2) For tractability, the original optimization problem is transformed to a biconcave maximization problem under certain approximations. Then, an alternative concave search (ACS) algorithm is designed to iteratively solve the transformed problem. We prove that the ACS algorithm converges to a set of partial optimal solutions;
3) Extensive simulation results provide insights for our proposed bandwidth slicing framework. First, the optimal bandwidth slicing ratios are independent of end device location changes when each device moves within its as-

sociated cell coverage area, which leads to low communication overhead for global network information exchange between each network cell and the central controller; Second, with our proposed bandwidth slicing framework, frequent BS-device re-association can be avoided in network dynamics; Third, the ACS algorithm is both robust and lightweight. In performance comparison with two other resource slicing schemes, the proposed framework reduces communication overhead, achieves high capacity in each cell, and provides high network utility. We organize the remainder of this paper in following sections. Existing resource slicing schemes are summarized in Section II. We describe the system model in Section III. In Section IV, a network utility maximization problem is formulated under the constraints of differentiated QoS provisioning for heterogeneous services. The original problem is transformed to a tractable biconcave maximization problem in Section V, and an ACS algorithm is then proposed to solve the transformed problem to obtain a set of optimal bandwidth slicing ratios and optimal BS-device association patterns. In Section VI, extensive simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed bandwidth slicing framework. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section VII. Important symbols are listed in Table I.
II. RELATED WORK
Due to its advantages in reducing infrastructure deployment cost and improving spectrum utilization, resource slicing in wireless networks has drawn attention from researchers. In [9], radio resource slices are created for different service providers (SPs) to obtain the requested service capacities and QoS isolation for different groups of end users. In [6], a resource allocation scheme is presented for a two-tier HetNet, where spectrum resources on each BS are sliced for different user groups belonging to different SPs to maximize the aggregate network utility. In [20], a resource-block (RB) slicing scheme is proposed for a single-cell LTE network supporting M2M communications. The RBs used in the random access phase in the LTE system are allocated to various categories of MTDs for differentiated QoS provisioning. Resource slicing for a multi-operator radio access network is investigated in [21], where different operators have different shares of the network infrastructure and the operators with larger shares are expected to receive more resources. Speciﬁcally, a BS-user association and resource allocation problem is jointly formulated to maximize a weighted sum of all operators’ utilities without service differentiation. Some ﬁne-grained ﬂow-level resource abstraction frameworks are proposed in literature to customize ﬂow scheduling policies for different applications [17], [22]. For instance, in [17], a service ﬂow is deﬁned as a ﬂow of packets transmitted between a BS and a user, either uplink or downlink, with speciﬁc QoS parameter settings. A two-level wireless resource abstraction framework is then developed to improve the resource utilization. At the service level, the uplink and downlink ﬂows of a BS are grouped to form slices for differentiated QoS provisioning; At the ﬂow-level, ﬂow scheduling policies are customized within each slice for packet transmissions at each time instant.

Existing studies mainly focus on the device-level resource slicing, in which the preallocated radio resources at each BS are sliced among different service groups within the BS coverage (e.g., in [6] and [20]). Radio access networks (RAN) sharing and network-level spectrum sharing are studied in [18], without an explicit characterization on differentiated trafﬁc statistics and QoS descriptions for heterogeneous services. The spectrum sharing is triggered when trafﬁc overload happens in one of the coexisting virtual networks.
In the following, we present a comprehensive radio resource slicing framework to facilitate resource sharing among heterogeneous BSs, with differentiated QoS provisioning for both data and M2M services, taking account of BS-device association patterns, and instantaneous trafﬁc load conditions for each cell.

III. SYSTEM MODEL
We consider a two-tier downlink HetNet, where a single macro-cell with a BS at the center in the ﬁrst tier is underlaid by n small cells (with BSs placed at cell centers) in the second tier, as shown in Fig. 1. There are two types of end devices distributed in the HetNet, i.e., MTDs with delay-sensitive machine-type trafﬁc requiring high transmission reliability, and MUs generating data trafﬁc and demanding high throughput. MUs are with low-to-moderate mobility, and MTDs are more or less stationary [16], [23]. The MBS, denoted by Bm, with high transmit power is deployed for a wide-area communication coverage, including both control signaling and data transmissions. The n SBSs, S = {S1, S2, ..., Sn}, with lower transmit power and smaller coverage, are placed at hotspot locations within the MBS’s coverage area to support the increasing communication demands. We assume that the MBS and SBSs are directly connected to edge routers of the core network via wired backhaul links. Since the HetNet is expected to accommodate a much larger number of M2M devices than MUs, the SBSs are speciﬁcally deployed to

enhance the network capacity in response to the increasing M2M trafﬁc volume [24]. In most of the cases, MUs in the coverage of the macro-cell are connected to the MBS [4], [24]. Occasionally, when some of the MUs move into the coverage of an SBS, they select to connect to either the homing SBS or the MBS. There are two categories of MTDs and MUs: category I and category II. A category I device is within the macro-cell coverage but outside the coverages of all small cells, and is associated with the MBS for information packet transmissions; A category II device stays within the coverages of both the macro-cell and one of the small cells, which chooses to be associated with either the MBS or the SBS depending on the network conditions, e.g., cell loads, channel

conditions and network utility. The set of category I MUs and the set of category I MTDs
along with their set cardinalities are denoted by Nu and Nu, and Na and Na, respectively, while the sets of category II MUs and MTDs and their set cardinalities in the coverage of Sk (k = 1, 2, ..., n) are denoted by Mk and Mk and Nk and Nk, among which some of the devices can be associated with the MBS. There are a number of transmission queues at each BS, each of which is used for downlink transmissions between the BS and an associated device. We use link-layer packetized trafﬁc to model arrivals of both data trafﬁc and M2M trafﬁc for explicit QoS characterization [25]. Data packets destined for an MU arrive at a transmission queue in the MBS periodically with rate λd packet/s, and each data packet has a constant size of Ld bits, whereas machine-type packets for an MTD arrive at the MBS or an SBS in an event-driven manner with a much lower packet arrival rate and a smaller packet size [16]. As suggested in [23], [26], machine-type packet arrivals at each transmission queue in a BS are modeled as a Poisson process with average rate of λa packet/s and constant packet size La bits. Due to the random nature of machine-type packet arrivals, the QoS can be guaranteed in a statistical way by applying the effective bandwidth theory [25], [27] (to be discussed in Section IV). All packets are transmitted through a wireless propagation channel to reach the destination device.

A. Communication Model

Suppose that two sets of radio resources, Wm and Ws, are initially allocated to the MBS and each SBS, respectively, and
are mutually orthogonal to avoid inter-tier interference. Since
each SBS maintains a small communication coverage with low transmit power, the resources Ws can be reused among all SBSs under an acceptable inter-cell interference level to improve the spectrum utilization. Transmit power for Bm and Sk (k = 1, 2, ..., n), denoted by Pm and Pk (k = 1, 2, ..., n), are pre-determined and remain constant during each resource
slicing period. Resource slicing is updated when trafﬁc load
of each cell ﬂuctuates [18]. A cell trafﬁc load is described
as a combination of number of devices admitted in the cell

and trafﬁc arrival statistics for each device. Using Shannon
capacity formula, the spectrum efﬁciency at device i from Bm and Sk (k = 1, 2, ..., n) are expressed, respectively, as

where Gi,m and Gi,k are squared average channel gains between Bm and Sk and device i, σ2 denotes average background noise power. Inter-cell interference among small cells is included in (2). In (1) and (2), ri,m and ri,k are measured in

a large time scale and are termed as spectrum efﬁciency [28], to capture long-term wireless channel conditions, which include the path loss effect. The achievable rate at each MTD and MU can be obtained based on BS-device association patterns and the received fraction of bandwidth resources from Bm or Sk.
Note that resource slicing among heterogeneous BSs, including BS-device association and bandwidth allocation for end devices, is updated in a large time scale compared with channel coherence time to reduce communication overhead [28]. Therefore, the received signal-to-noise (SNR) and signalto-interference-plus-noise (SINR) in (1) and (2) are average SNR and SINR over each resource slicing period [18], in which channel fast fading effects are averaged out.
B. Dynamic Bandwidth Slicing Framework
As stated in Section I, in the two-tier HetNet supporting heterogeneous services, the preallocated radio resources at each BS can be inefﬁcient due to unbalanced end device distribution, varying device locations, and increasing network load on each cell [21]. Consequently, some of the BSs are overloaded, while the resources on other light-loaded BSs can be underutilized. Additionally, a massive number of MTDs accessing the network can possibly cause QoS violation for existing users if resources are not efﬁciently managed between data service and M2M service [24], [29]. Therefore, proper resource slicing is an effective solution 1) to facilitate radio resource sharing among heterogeneous wireless infrastructures (MBSs and SBSs), and 2) to ensure QoS isolation among diverse services. Such resource slicing framework is required to balance the trade-off between resource sharing and QoS isolation. On one hand, resources are partitioned into different slices and allocated to M2M service and data service for differentiated QoS satisfaction; On the other hand, the amount of resources for each slice should be dynamically adjusted according to variations of network conditions to improve resource utilization. Therefore, a dynamic resource slicing framework needs to be developed with the consideration of both network conditions (i.e., end-device location distribution, cell loads, inter-cell interference levels, and BS-device association patterns) and service-level characteristics (i.e., trafﬁc statistics and QoS requirements for heterogeneous services). Moreover, since MUs are with low-to-moderate mobility and MTDs are more or less stationary, resources for each slice are expected to be updated in a large time scale to reduce the communication overhead for network information exchange between the central controller and the BSs.
With wireless NFV, the controller has central control over all bandwidth resources from heterogeneous BSs, the amount of which is denoted by Wv (Wv = Wm + Ws). Note that we consider radio spectrum bandwidth as the resource provisioning [9]. Resource slicing is realized in two steps: In the ﬁrst step, the total bandwidth resources are sliced among the MBS and SBSs, as shown in Fig. 2. The central controller needs to specify how bandwidth resources are allocated among BSs to achieve maximal resource utilization and, at the same time, guarantee QoS isolation between M2M and data services. We deﬁne βm and βs (with βm + βs =1) as slicing ratios, indicating the shares of bandwidth resources (out of Wv)

allocated to the MBS and SBSs, respectively. To determine the optimal set of slicing ratios, {βm∗ , βs∗}, we formulate a comprehensive optimization framework to maximize the
aggregate network utility under the constraints of satisfying
the differentiated QoS requirements for both types of services,
by taking into account the network conditions and service-
level characteristics (see details in Section IV). The slicing
ratios are adjusted between bandwidth slices in response to the
network trafﬁc load dynamics to improve the overall resource
utilization. In the second step, since the MBS and SBSs
support both data and M2M services, the bandwidth slices
are further split to two sub-slices and allocated to the group
of MUs and the group of MTDs associated with corresponding BSs, with the bandwidth slice splitting ratios denoted by βm∗ ,1 and βm∗ ,2, and βs∗,1 and βs∗,2, respectively, as shown in Fig 2. Therefore, from the service-level standpoint, we deﬁne slicing ratios α1∗ (= βm∗ ,1 + βs∗,1) and α2∗ (= βm∗ ,2 + βs∗,2), as the fractions of bandwidth resources allocated to the data service
and the M2M service, respectively.

IV. PROBLEM FORMULATION
In the proposed bandwidth slicing framework, the challenging issue is how to determine the set of optimal slicing ratios, {βm∗ , βs∗}, to 1) maximize the aggregate network utility, and 2) satisfy diverse QoS requirements between M2M and data services.
We consider the following logarithmic functions, as utility functions for an MU or an MTD (either category I or category II) associated with Bm and the utility for a category II MU or MTD associated with Sk, respectively:
log (ci,m) = log (Wvβmfi,mri,m) , i ∈ Nu ∪ Na ∪ Nk ∪ Mk,
k = {1, 2, ..., n} (3)
log (ci,k) = log (Wvβsfi,kri,k) , i ∈ Nk ∪ Mk, (4) k = {1, 2, ..., n}.
In (3) and (4), ci,m denotes the achievable rate at device i associated with Bm, and ci,k the achievable rate at category II device i from Sk; fi,m is the fraction of bandwidth resources (out of Wvβm) allocated to device i from Bm, and fi,k the fraction of bandwidth resources (out of Wvβs) allocated to category II device i from Sk. The logarithmic utility function is

a concave function having diminishing marginal utility, which facilitates network load balancing in BS-device association and achieves certain fairness in resource allocation among end devices [6], [18], [21].
As stated in Section III-A, the downlink achievable rates, ci,m and ci,k, are constant during each bandwidth slicing period, and data packets, destined for an MU, arrive at one of the transmission queues in Bm periodically. Thus, the throughput requirement for each MU can be satisﬁed deterministically if enough resources are allocated for each downlink data transmission. However, due to the stochastic trafﬁc arrival of the event-driven M2M service, the downlink total transmission delay from Bm or Sk to an MTD should be guaranteed statistically for maximal resource utilization. The delay is the duration from the instant a machine-type packet arrives at a BS transmission queue to the instant the intended MTD receives the packet. We apply the effective bandwidth theory to derive the minimum service rate for each MTD to probabilistically guarantee a packet transmission delay bound.
The effective bandwidth for a machine-type trafﬁc source, with a QoS exponent, ϕM , is expressed as

(ϕM )

(5)

where A(t) denotes the number of machine-type packet ar-

rivals over [0, t), and E[·] denotes the operation of expectation.

Since A(t) is modeled as a Poisson process with the rate of

λa packet/s, (5) is further derived as [27]

(ϕM

(6)

On the other hand, by applying the large deviation the-
ory [30], [31], the probability of downlink total transmission delay Di,j for a machine-type packet from BS j to MTD i exceeding a delay bound Dmax is approximated as

P r{Di,j ≥ Dmax} ≈ e−ϕM pi,j Dmax ≤ ε

(7)

where i ∈ Na ∪ Nk if j = m for MBS Bm, and i ∈ Nk if

is the achievable

rate at MTD i from BS j in terms of number of packets per

is given by

log ε − ϕM Dmax

.

(8)

According to the effective bandwidth theory [30], p(min)

should equal the effective bandwidth (ϕM ) to guarantee the delay bound violation probability at most ε. Therefore, by

substituting (8) into (6) and after some algebraic manipulation,

we have

In (P1), the objective function is the aggregate network
utility, which is the summation of utilities achieved by all devices. A category I device is associated with Bm, whereas a category II device chooses to connect to either Bm or Sk. Hence, a binary variable, xi,j (i ∈ Nk ∪ Mk, j ∈ {m, k}, k ∈ {1, 2, ..., n}), is introduced to indicate the association pattern for category II device i with Bm or Sk. Device i is associated with Bm, if xi,m = 1 and xi,k = 0; Otherwise, it is associated with Sk, if xi,m = 0 and xi,k = 1.
In (P1), constraints (10a) and (10d) indicate that the service rate ci,j for any MU i is not less than the periodic trafﬁc arrival rate destined for the device at the base station. Constraints
(10b) and (10c) ensure that the achievable rate for both
category I and category II MTDs is not less than the effective
bandwidth of the M2M trafﬁc source. Constraint (10e) and
(10f) indicate that a category II device is associated with
either the MBS or its home SBS during each bandwidth
allocation period. Constraints (10g) and (10h) demonstrate the
requirements on bandwidth allocation for MTDs and MUs
from different BSs. Therefore, by maximizing the aggregate
network utility with QoS guarantee, the optimal set of slicing ratios βm∗ and βs∗, BS-device association indicators x∗i,j, and fractions of bandwidth resources fi∗,m and fi∗,k allocated to MTDs and MUs from Bm and Sk can be determined.
Since (P1) is a joint BS-device association and resource
allocation problem, the fraction of bandwidth resources al-
located to each device depends on all BS-device association
patterns and resource slicing ratios among BSs, and this
coupling makes the problem difﬁcult to solve. For tractability, given BS-device association patterns xi,j and resource slicing ratios {βm, βs}, we ﬁrst determine the optimal fractions of bandwidth resources fi∗,m and fi∗,k allocated to device i from Bm and Sk, in a function of xi,j, to maximize the aggregate network utility.

A. Optimal Bandwidth Allocation to MUs and MTDs
We simplify (P1) by expressing fi,j as a function of xi,j to reduce the number of decision variables. Given βm, βs, and xi,j, the objective function of (P1) can be expressed as a summation of u(m1)(fi,m) and n u(k1)(fi,k). Hence, u(m1)(fi,m)
k=1
is a function of fi,m, indicating the aggregate utility of MUs and MTDs associated with Bm, given by

u(m1)(fi,m) =

log (Wvβmfi,mri,m)

i∈Nu ∪Na n

+

log (Wvβmfi,mri,m)

k=1 i∈Nk

(11)

where Nk = {l ∈ Nk ∪Mk|xl,m = 1}, u(k1)(fi,k) is a function of fi,k, denoting the aggregate utility of category II devices associating with Sk, given by

u(k1)(fi,k) =

log (Wvβsfi,kri,k)

(12)

i∈Nk

with Nk = {l ∈ Nk ∪ Mk|xl,k = 1}. Hence, (P1) can be written as (P1 ):

From (P1 ), {fi,m} and {fi,k} are two independent sets of decision variables with uncoupled constraints. Thus, (P1 ) is

The proof of Proposition 1 is provided in Appendix A. Proposition 1 indicates that the optimal fractions of bandwidth resources allocated to MUs and MTDs from the associated BSs are equal bandwidth partitioning.

Since the two sets of decision variables {βm, Xm} and {βs, Xk} are coupled by constraints (18g) and (18i), (P2) cannot be decoupled in the same way as (P1 ). The simpliﬁed problem (P2) is a mixed-integer combinatorial problem with the binary variable set {xi,j}, which is difﬁcult to solve. Therefore, in the next section, we transform (P2) to a tractable
form for optimal solutions.

V. PROBLEM TRANSFORMATION AND PARTIAL OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS

To make (P2) tractable, we ﬁrst relax the binary variables

{xi,j} in (P2) to real-valued variables {xi,j} within the range

[0, 1]. Variables {xi,j} represent the fraction of time that

device i is associated with Bm or Sk during each bandwidth

slicing period [6]. With the variable relaxation, the objective

function n u(k2)

of (P2) βs, Xk

becomes , where

u(m2)(βm, Xm) and ∈ Nk ∪ Mk, k ∈

k=1

{1, 2, ..., n}} and Xk = {xi,k|i ∈ Nk ∪ Mk}. In Proposi-

tion
n

2, we u(k2)

state the βs, Xk ,

bi-concavity property of u(m2)(βm, Xm) and based on Deﬁnition 1 and Deﬁnition 2.

k=1

Deﬁnition 1. Suppose set Y can be expressed as the Cartesian

product of two subsets A ∈ Rm and B ∈ Rn, i.e., Y = A

× B. Then, Y is called a biconvex set on A × B, if A is a

convex subset for any given b ∈ B, and B is also a convex

subset for any given a ∈ A.

Deﬁnition 2. Function F : Y → R is deﬁned on a biconvex set Y = A × B, where A ∈ Rm and B ∈ Rn. Then, F (A, B)

is called a biconcave (biconvex) function if it is a concave (convex) function on subset A for any given b ∈ B, and it is also a concave (convex) function on subset B for any given a ∈ A.

Proposition 2. n u(k2) βs, Xk

Both are

u(m2)(βm, Xm) and the summation (strictly) biconcave functions on the

k=1

biconvex decision variable set {βm, βs} × {Xm, Xk, k ∈

{1, 2, ..., n}}.

The proof of Proposition 2 is given in Appendix B. With the variable relaxation, (P2) is transformed to (P3):

In (P3), the objective function is a nonnegative sum of two (strictly) biconcave functions, which is also (strictly) biconcave [32]. Note that fm∗ and fk∗ are fm∗ and fk∗ with xi,m and xi,k substituted by xi,m and xi,k. Moreover, if all the constraint functions in (P3) are written in a standard form, constraints (21a) and (21b) represent linear inequality
constraint functions, and constraints (21g) and (21i) represent
afﬁne equality constraint functions, with respect to the set
of decision variables. However, constraints (21c) - (21f) are
non-convex constraint functions. Constraints (21c) and (21d) actually indicate that if any i ∈ Nk ∪ Mk (k ∈ {1, 2, ..., n}) is associated with Bm, the following inequalities should be

Therefore, to make (P3) tractable, we simplify (P3) to (P3 ), by substituting (21c) - (21f) with (22) - (25), respectively:

Compared to the set of constraints (21a) - (21d) in (P3), constraints (21a), (21b), (22) and (23) in (P3 ) provide the lowest upper bound on the number of category II devices that can be associated with Bm. This lowest upper bound is accurate because the communication distance between the
MBS and any device located in the coverage of an SBS is
much longer than the location differences among MTDs and MUs in the same SBS; thus, the differences of ri,m among the end devices are relatively small. Similarly, compared with constraints (21e) and (21f) in (P3), constraints (24) and (25) in (P3 ) indicate the lowest upper bound on the number of category II devices that can be associated with Sk, k ∈ {1, 2, ..., n}. In fact, without changing the optimal solutions for (P3), the simpliﬁed constraints (22) - (25) in (P3 ) indicate a set of conservative limits on maximum numbers of category II MTDs and MUs that can be associated with Bm and Sk, k ∈ {1, 2, ..., n}.
In a standard form, (P3 ) is a biconcave maximization problem due to the biconcave objective function and the set
of biconvex constraint functions with respect to the biconvex decision variable set {βm, βs} × {Xm, Xk} [32]. To solve (P3 ), an alternative concave search (ACS) algorithm is designed to explore the bi-concavity of the problem. The
procedure of the ACS algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1. As stated in Proposition 3, due to some properties of (P3 ), Algorithm 1 converges to a set of partial optimal solutions. The deﬁnition of a partial optimal solution for (P3 ) is given in Corollary 1, based on Proposition 3 and Theorem 4.7 in
[32].
Proposition 3. Algorithm 1 converges, due to the following properties for (P3 ): (1) Both {βm, βs} and {Xm, Xk} are closed sets, and the objective function of (P3 ) is

continuous on its domain; (2) Given the set of accumu-

i.e., whether the difference between the objective function

values at the end of current iteration and at the end of

previous iteration is smaller than a predeﬁned threshold (set

VI. SIMULATION RESULTS
Simulation results are presented in this section which demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed bandwidth slicing framework. All the simulations are carried out using MATLAB. In the two-tier wireless HetNet with 1 MBScentered macro-cell underlaid by 4 SBS-centered small cells, locations of the MBS and SBSs are ﬁxed, and the distance between the MBS and each of the SBSs are set as 400 m. Suppose the MBS is located at the orgin of a Cartesian coordinate system,√and the 4 S√BSs are at the respective coordinates of (±200 2 m, ±200 2 m). The downlink transmit power on the MBS is set to 40 dBm with the communication coverage radius of 600 m, whereas each SBS has identical transmit power of 30 dBm with the coverage radius of 200 m [4]. All category I devices are randomly distributed in the coverage of the MBS (Category I MUs and MTDs are outside the coverages of SBSs.); Category II devices are randomly deployed within the coverages of SBSs, and each small cell is set an equal number of category II MTDs and category II MUs, denoted by Ns and Ms, respectively. In each small cell, Ms is set to 10. For propagation models, we use Lm(z) = −30 − 35 log10(z) and Ls(z) = −40 − 35 log10(z) to describe the downlink channel gains for the macro-cell and each small cell, respectively, including the path loss effect, where z is the distance between a BS and a device. The periodic data packet arrival rate λd at a transmission queue of the MBS is 20 packet/s, and the average rate λa of machine-type packet arrivals (following a Poisson process) at each transmission queue of either the MBS or an SBS is 5 packet/s. Each simulation result is obtained upon averaging over 50 location distribution samples of MUs and MTDs. Other important system parameters for simulations are summarized in Table II.
Through extensive simulations, we ﬁrst demonstrate the robustness of the proposed bandwidth slicing framework, where a set of optimal bandwidth slicing ratios are obtained with low computational complexity and are dynamically adjusted with lightweight communication overhead. Then, we compare the proposed bandwidth slicing framework with an SINR-maximization (SINR-max) based network-level resource slicing scheme mentioned in [6], in which radio resources are shared among heterogeneous BSs and each device is associated with the BS providing highest downlink SINR, and a devicelevel resource slicing scheme [6], i.e., bandwidth resources are preallocated to each BS, and are then sliced for different device groups in the coverage region of the BS.

A. Optimal Bandwidth Slicing Ratios
In Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), the solutions for bandwidth slicing ratio, βs, in each iteration of Algorithm 1 are plotted. In Fig. 3(a), given the numbers of MUs and MTDs in the macrocell and each small cell, βs converges to the same optimal solution, regardless of the location distribution for MUs and MTDs. The same property is observed under a different network load condition in Fig. 3(b). This insight demonstrates the robustness of the proposed resource slicing framework, upon which the set of optimal slicing ratios stay steady with end device location changes inside each cell. Therefore, the slicing ratios are adjusted in a large time scale, which signiﬁcantly reduces network information exchange between each cell and the central controller for updating the slicing ratios.
Fig. 4 reﬂects the robustness of using the proposed ACS algorithm to solve for the optimal bandwidth slicing ratio βs∗. It can be seen that the optimal solution βs∗ does not vary with initial slicing ratio βsini. For service-level QoS provisioning and isolation, the optimal bandwidth slicing ratio α2∗ for all MTDs in the network is also shown in Fig. 4. From both Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, we conclude that the set of optimal bandwidth slicing ratios {βm∗ , βs∗} vary with the numbers of MUs and MTDs in each cell.
Fig. 5 shows the computational complexity of the proposed ACS algorithm, where the average number of iterations for solving βs∗ is evaluated with respect to different initial values for βs and different values of Nu and Na in the macro-cell. The average iteration number is low over a wide range of βsini, Nu, Na, and Ns. Based on a comparison of Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, we observe that the average number of iterations decreases when βsini approaches βs∗.
B. Performance Comparison
In Fig. 6, optimal bandwidth slicing ratios are compared between the proposed slicing framework and the SINR-max based network-level slicing scheme for different values of Nu, Na, and Ns. In the SINR-max based slicing scheme, since each device is always associated with the BS providing the highest SINR, the BS-device association patterns should change upon variations of end device locations. Accordingly, radio resources need to be frequently adjusted to adapt to the changing load on each BS. Fig. 6 shows that the optimal bandwidth slicing ratio in the SINR-max based slicing scheme ﬂuctuates with different MUs and MTDs distribution samples. In comparison, the proposed bandwidth slicing framework is more robust with network condition changes, and the slicing ratios are updated in a much larger time scale to reduce communication overhead.

In contrast, for the proposed resource slicing framework, under central control, radio resources can be dynamically adjusted among heterogeneous BSs in response to the network load changes, which makes the resource management more ﬂexible and signiﬁcantly reduces the communication cost as MTDs and MUs do not need to re-associate their connections with different BSs.

Fig. 8 shows that the optimal bandwidth slicing ratios βs∗ and α2∗ are dynamically updated with the number of MTDs, Ns, in each SBS, whereas the bandwidth resources are ﬁxed on each BS for the device-level resource slicing scheme. Therefore, the cost of the proposed resource slicing framework is that the central controller needs to periodically obtain updated network load information from each BS for the slicing ratio adjustment. This signaling cost is relatively low since the load in each cell does not change in a small time scale.

increasing the maximum number of devices in each cell. We ﬁrst evaluate the maximum number of MUs and MTDs admitted in the macro-cell under the condition that QoS requirements for 99% of MUs are satisﬁed. Since MUs require more bandwidth resources than MTDs, the QoS for MUs are violated ﬁrst with the increase of cell load. We then evaluate the maximum number of MTDs admitted in each small cell at the premise of not violating the QoS for all MTDs (Assume that no category II MUs exist in each small cell for evaluating the maximum number of admitted devices in both the macro-cell and small cells.). In Fig. 9(a), the proposed resource slicing framework achieves a much larger number of devices admitted in the macro-cell than the device-level resource slicing scheme where the macro-cell’s admission region is ﬁxed without resource sharing under different Ns. Similar trend for the maximum number of MTDs admitted in small cells is observed in Fig. 9(b). Although some of the MTDs can be ofﬂoaded to the MBS for the device-level resource slicing scheme, the number of MTDs admitted in the macro-cell is limited due to the QoS provisioning for MUs and the utilization of bandwidth resources for the MBS.

bound variation probability) among all MTDs in the HetNet is evaluated with the variation of the number of MTDs in each SBS. It is shown in Fig. 10 that the maximum packet loss probability increases with Ns due to the reduced fractions of bandwidth resources allocated to each device. We can also see that the proposed bandwidth slicing framework guarantees the maximum packet loss probability be bounded by a threshold when the number of category II MTDs varies within the admission region of each small cell.
Lastly, the aggregate network utility of the macro-cell underlaid by small cells, achieved by different resource slicing schemes, is evaluated with variations of Nu, Na and Ns in Figs. 11(a) and 11(b). For the proposed bandwidth slicing framework, we also evaluate the effect of the approximations (i.e., the variable relaxation) made for solving (P2). It is clear that the network utility achieved by the set of fractional BS-device optimal association patterns {xi,m∗, xi,k∗} matches closely with the one achieved by the exact binary optimal solutions {x∗i,m, x∗i,k} after the rounding operation. Moreover, through bandwidth slicing among heterogeneous BSs, the overall network resource utilization, and thus the network throughput, are signiﬁcantly improved. Therefore, it can be seen that our proposed resource slicing framework achieves higher network utility than both the SINR-max based networklevel resource slicing scheme and the device-level resource slicing scheme.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a dynamic radio resource slicing framework for a two-tier HetNet to determine a set of resource slicing ratios and BS-device association patterns under different network load conditions. Based on SDN-enabled radio function softwarization, spectrum bandwidth resources are centrally managed and sliced among heterogeneous BSs to improve resource utilization and achieve QoS isolation for the coexistence of data service and M2M service. To obtain a set of optimal bandwidth slicing ratios for each BS, a network utility maximization problem is formulated under the constraints of differentiated QoS guarantee for data and M2M

services, BS-device association patterns, and resource allocation among end devices. To reduce complexity, the original optimization problem is transformed to a tractable biconcave maximization problem. Then, an alternative concave search algorithm is designed to solve the transformed problem for a set of optimal slicing ratios and optimal BS-device association patterns. Simulation results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithm due to its good convergence property and low computational complexity. In comparison with the two other resource slicing schemes, the proposed framework has lower communication overhead for updating the slicing ratios, achieves a larger device admission region for each cell, and provides higher network utility.

APPENDIX A. PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1
For brevity, only the proof for (17) in Proposition 1 is provided. Since the bandwidth, Ws, is reused among all SBSs and the fraction of bandwidth resources allocated to device i from one SBS is independent of the fraction allocated to device q from another SBS, (S2P1 ) can be decoupled into n

subproblems, each for one SBS. The subproblem for the SBS Sk (k ∈ {1, 2, ..., n}) is formulated as

(S2P1

− 1) : max





fi,k = 1



s.t. i∈Nk

  fi,k ∈ (0, 1),

The objective function of (S2P1 − 1) can be further derived

as

Since ri,k is considered constant during each bandwidth slicing

to

Since geometric average is no greater than arithmetic average,

we have

where the equal sign holds when fi,k = fl,k, ∀ i, l ∈ Nk, and | · | denotes a set cardinality. Thus, by satisfying constraints

Since the Hessian matrix H u(m2) βm, Xm is negative
deﬁnite, u(m2) βm, Xm is a (strictly) concave function in
terms of Xm for any ﬁxed βm. Conversely, it is obvious that u(m2)(βm, Xm) is a (strictly) concave function with respect to βm for any given Xm.
Similarly, u(k2) βs, Xk can also be proved as a (strictly) biconcave function. The summation n u(k2) βs, Xk is a
