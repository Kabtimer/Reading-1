VANET
Vehicular networking is an area of signiﬁcant importance in the connected and mobile world where we live Vehicles are everywhere, they have a penetration rate of about 70% in most developed countries Cars manufactures are starting to equip vehicles with network interfaces such as WiFi, 3G ...
Car are the ideal candidates to become nodes of a pervasive wireless mobile network

NDN - the best ﬁt for VANET
NDN puts contents at the center of its communication model
IP is host centric: it has diﬃculties coping with mobility and multihoming Naming data decouples communication from speciﬁc interfaces and endpoints. NDN naturally supports multihoming and mobility. Each application names the data it wants to fetch or provide The network directly uses these names to process the packets

VANET nowadays
We should be able to fully utilize all the network interfaces a car will be equipped with IP based approaches don’t facilitate multihoming and mobility
IP puts addresses and hosts at the center of its communication model The communication is tied to the network interface, to its IP address

Cars roles in V-NDN

In V-NDN cars can play all the 4 roles in NDN architecture:

Consumer of traﬃc status information, music entertainment ...

Producer of data provided by sensors car for accident alerts ...

Forwarder: A car actively participates to the communication forwarding packets

NDN A

NDN B
Mule: storing received

contents in the CS, a car

Three NDN entities •  Publisher: A car generating data •  Consumer: A car requesting data •  Mule: A car caching and forwarding data A car can have more than one role at a time.

V-NDN: Realization
14 / 45

Realization - NDN Daemon
It provides the core NDN capabilities by maintaining the key data structures of CS and PIT and taking care of name preﬁx-matching and packet forwarding decisions.
15 / 45

Realization - Forwarding Interests
Controlled ﬂooding: The V-NDN Daemon takes a simple approach of forwarding each Interest to all the interfaces that are available at the time
16 / 45

Realization - Network Faces
V2I communication: the face uses IP connectivity to reach NDN nodes in the core network V2V communication: a 2.5 layer has been designed, the Link Adaptation Layer
17 / 45

Realization - Link Adaptation Layer
Link Adaptation Layer as 2.5 layer
The LAL is designed speciﬁcally for 802.11 broadcast communication. It provides reliability services (retransmission, acknowledgment) not supported by 802.11 (broadcast)
18 / 45

V2V communications
When you are looking for something, all your neighbors can help ”One to one” communications limit your chances in ﬁnding the information you want. Broadcast communication, instead, allows all the cars around you to collaborate
V-NDN takes full advantage from the broadcast nature of the wireless channel, by directly communicate using 802.11 broadcast frame
802.11 broadcast communication has a limit: the communication is more vulnerable
lack of collision detection/avoidance mechanism, retransmission, acknowledgment, RTS/CTS
19 / 45

LAL: broadcast support
Implicit acknowledgement
The Link Adaptation Layer introduces an acknowledgment - retransmission process
When a car forwards a packet, transmission of the same packet by neighbors are considered as implicit acknowledgment Implicit acknowledgments from each of the streets stemming from where the car is located acknowledge the packet Packet not acknowledged will be retransmitted After “n” unsuccessful attempts, the packet is dropped
20 / 45

LAL: broadcast support
The red car receives a packet from the grey car
21 / 45

LAL: broadcast support
The red car forwards the packet
22 / 45

LAL: broadcast support
The red car will wait for an implicit ack for each of the streets stemming from where the car is located, except the street where the grey car is situated
23 / 45

LAL: broadcast support
The red car overhears the retransmission from another car: it’s the ﬁrst implicit acknowledgment
24 / 45

LAL: broadcast support
The red car overhears the retransmission from another car: it’s the second implicit acknowledgment
25 / 45

LAL: broadcast support
The retransmission timer is expired and the packet has not been acknowledged yet. The red caw will retransmit
26 / 45

LAL: broadcast support
The red car overhears the retransmission from the last street stem: the packet has been acknowledged
27 / 45

LAL: avoiding the broadcast storm
If everybody talk, nobody hears
If all the cars forward the same packet at the same time, the communication will stop Solution: prioritize the transmission based on the position of the cars, on the distance among the cars and the previous hop Cars farther from the previous hop will forward the packet ﬁrst
28 / 45

LAL: avoiding the broadcast storm
Two cars (red and grey) receive the same packet
29 / 45

LAL: avoiding the broadcast storm
Both cars will calculate the Waiting Timer based on the distance among them and the previous hop
30 / 45

LAL: avoiding the broadcast storm
The red car is farther, than its Waiting Timer will be smaller
31 / 45

LAL: avoiding the broadcast storm
The grey car overhears the packet transmitted by the red car and it will cancel its transmission of the same packet
32 / 45

LAL: avoiding the broadcast storm
A waiting Timer based only on distance is not enough: cars with similar distance to the previous hop will transmit at “the same time” Solution: adding a small random component to the Waiting Timer

Experiments on the ﬁeld
As proof of concept, we performed a number of ﬁeld experiments with 10 cars around the UCLA campus
35 / 45

Experiments on the ﬁeld
Two application were running: Info-Traﬃc application and Photo application
All the cars were equipped with WiFi Ad-Hoc interfaces. A subset of them was equipped with an additional network interface (WiMax or WiFi in Infrastructure Mode)
36 / 45

Results: Data survives Producer
Data is decoupled from its container - producer
Once a piece of data has been spread in the network, its availability becomes independent from the connectivity to its producer. As proof of concept, we design the following test:
Only one producer is running After answering to the ﬁrst consumer request, the producer is turned oﬀ Later, a second consumer asks for the same content As expected, the second consumer was able to get the desired content from other cars (consumer or mules)
37 / 45

Results: Multihoming

Fetching data by name enables multihoming
V-NDN possesses the innate ability of utilizing node multihoming to communicate with other cars via Ad-Hoc WiFi on the Internet via 3G/4G/WiFi connectivity simultaneously.

Simulations
The experiments on the ﬁeld are limited in scale We used simulation to explored the scalability of V-NDN approach for Ad-Hoc communication In a urban scenario (a residential area of Los Angeles) with dense traﬃc (695 cars) we analyzed the behavior of V-NDN:
The satisfaction time for the Info-Traﬃc application The overhead to get the desired content
40 / 45

Simulations: Satisfaction Time
In a system where the same information can be helpful to multiple users, V-NDN can bring great beneﬁts
By letting all cars caching overheard information, they become data mules. Not only a car can help forward a content that it has just received, but it can also carry the content and answer Interests for the same content in the future.

Remaining challenges
Forwarding strategies able to direct the Interest toward the location where the content is, instead of use controlled ﬂooding of the network Names design: How can names help the forwarding process? Encoding geolocation into names for location-based data can help. But what about the other content? Security and privacy: how to provide consumers with authenticated data but without the exposure of producers identity
43 / 45

Summary
V-NDN exploits NDN strengths and extend the NDN paradigm to adapt to VANET scenario By naming data rather than hosts:
Can fully utilize all the available network interfaces as soon as they are available. The communication can start spontaneously, IP assignment process for V2V communication is no longer required The communication is resilient to connectivity disruptions: mules overcome interruptions in the communication among consumer and producer
