Title: A Thorough Study of LoRaWAN Performance Under Different Parameter Settings
Authors: Davide Magrin , Martina Capuzzo , Andrea Zanella
(Submitted on 12 Jun 2019)

    Abstract: LoRaWAN is an emerging Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology, which is gaining momentum thanks to its flexibility and ease of deployment. Conversely to other LPWAN solutions, LoRaWAN indeed permits the configuration of several network parameters that affect different network performance indexes, such as energy efficiency, fairness, and capacity, in principle making it possible to adapt the network behavior to the specific requirements of the application scenario. Unfortunately, the complex and sometimes elusive interactions among the different network components make it rather difficult to predict the actual effect of a certain parameters setting, so that flexibility can turn into a stumbling block if not deeply understood. In this paper we shed light on such complex interactions, by observing and explaining the effect of different parameters settings in some illustrative scenarios. The simulation-based analysis reveals various trade-offs and highlights some inefficiencies in the design of the LoRaWAN standard. Furthermore, we show how significant performance gains can be obtained by wisely setting the system parameters, possibly in combination with some novel network management policies.
