QoS-Aware Scheduling of Services-Oriented Internet of Things
Ling Li, Shancang Li, and Shanshan Zhao

Abstract—The Internet of Things (IoT) contains a large number of different devices and heterogeneous networks, which make it difﬁcult to satisfy different quality of service (QoS) requirements and achieve rapid services composition and deployment. In addition, some services in service-oriented IoT are required to be reconﬁgurable and composable for QoS-aware services. This paper proposed a three-layer QoS scheduling model for service-oriented IoT. At application layer, the QoS schedule scheme explores optimal QoS-aware services composition by using the knowledge of each component service. At network layer, the model aims at dealing with scheduling of heterogeneous networks environment; at sensing layer, it deals with the information acquisition and resource allocation scheduling for different services. The proposed QoS-aware scheduling for service-oriented IoT architecture is able to optimize the scheduling performance of IoT network and minimize the resource costs.
Index Terms—Internet of Things (IoT), quality of service (QoS), wireless sensor networks (WSNs).
I. INTRODUCTION
W E ARE in an age of witnessing the transformation of society from a physical world into a digitalized world [1], where the objects can be interconnected through Internet of Things (IoT) [2]–[4]. Actually, increasing number of interesting services and applications have been developed by exploiting radio-frequency identiﬁcation (RFID), wireless sensor/mesh networks (WSNs/WMNs), mobile networks, WLAN, and Internet to improve the efﬁciency and lower the cost of business processes in enterprise information systems [5]–[9]. Each thing that connects to IoT can be seen as an edge-node of IoT, which is able to sense ambient scenarios and bridge the gap between networks and the real world [10]. The huge number of different links and interactions between edge-nodes in IoT makes it a scalable complex system; therefore, brings difﬁculties for satisfying the dynamic QoS requirements of services [11], [12].
In service-oriented scenarios, the IoT provides a dynamic service creation environment for new applications, means, and tools to monitor the business process or network parameter changes. It suffers from some common obstacles, such as limited energy, real-time adaptive sensing, and fault tolerance to

component failures, which can be described in composite quality of services (QoSs) guarantee support. A number of QoS models have been developed for traditional networks [11], [13]–[16]. However, the QoS management in IoT is still poorly studied [14], [17], [18]. The deﬁnition of QoS in IoT is still not clear because the deﬁnition of service in IoT is not exactly the same, in which a service can be deﬁned as the simple acquisition and processing of information and the decision making process in identiﬁcation, communication, and so on [19]. The traditional QoS attributes such as throughput, delay, or jitter are evidently inappropriate in IoT [11]–[20]. In IoT, more QoS attributes are concerned, such as information accuracy (that is qualiﬁed with the probability that an accuracy can be reached), the network resources needed, required energy consumption, and the coverage of IoT. To solve the difﬁculties mentioned above, a new QoS model for serviceoriented IoT is necessary, which must be able to balance the network availability with the quality of information in delivering sensory data [21]–[23]. On the other hand, the information ﬁtness or information accuracy for a service is the key to merging the gap between sensory data and actual world [24], which involves information acquisition, processing, transmission, and energy consumption.
In this paper, we propose a three-layer QoS model for serviceoriented IoT, which requires the following features.
1) QoS provisioning in IoT is investigated in terms of decision-making over the application layer, the network layer, and the sensing layer.
2) The QoS model based on the above-mentioned three-layer service-oriented architecture is proposed, in which a top-down decision-making process is proposed for QoS guarantee in IoT through qualitative methods.
3) The QoS analysis framework is given to evaluate services, networks, and sensing devices, which is able to guide the optimization of attributes of QoS in IoT.
4) The decision-making process that includes the optimization algorithms for three layers is provided.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II summarizes related works. Section III discusses the QoS architecture of IoT. Section IV provides a decision-making model for QoS in service-oriented IoT. Section V veriﬁes the feasibility and effectiveness of proposed mechanisms. Section IV concludes the paper.
II. RELATED WORKS
Although a lot of research results have been reported in the past decade [12]–[25], most research works focus on the QoS support for traditional networks [22]–[26]. Little research efforts

are found over service-oriented IoT although it provides an exciting and promising vision for seamlessly connecting the virtual world of information to the real world [26].
QoS in service-oriented IoT needs to consider the new features of IoT. The successful implementation of IoT might involve a number of emerging techniques, such as RFID, WSN, mobile technologies, WLAN, and the QoS provisioning on application layer. The WSN is a suitable example of edge-network of IoT and many research works about QoS in WSNs are available. In [16], [17], [27], and [28], the QoS requirements for WSN are split into a number of subtasks at media access control (MAC) layer and network layer. An M-QoMoR protocol was proposed to analyze the QoS performances of group-organized nodes [16], [17]. Actually, it is an extension of traditional QoS framework without considering the resource limitation in IoT. In [18], the dynamic services support in the IoT environment is studied. In [20], Rohokale et al. discussed a cooperative QoS scheme for healthcare system, in which the QoS constraints healthcare conditions metrics. In [19], a multidimensional QoS decision model is proposed, where each stakeholder is mapped into a single value that is used to determine the best conﬁguration of interactions.
Most of the existing researches in IoT focus on two aspects: 1) QoS-based design for routing or MAC schemes, i.e., QoS design in the service-oriented WSNs [20]–[22], cross-layer QoS-aware routing [22], and energy-efﬁcient routing approach [23] and 2) QoS supported for multimedia trafﬁc ﬂows, such as the end-to-end delay, jitter, and throughput [24]. Many QoS schemes have been proposed to solve real-time or best-effort (BE) scheduling tasks. By doing this, the performances can be slightly improved but QoS problems cannot be solved. It is needed to redesign a QoS-aware scheduling scheme in serviceoriented IoT according to the new features.
III. QOS ARCHITECTURE OF IOT
A. Composite QoS in IoT
The research on architecture is essential in the development of IoT that involves a huge number of heterogonous devices, complex data, and actions such as collection, processing, transmission, and storage.
Recently, many cross-layer approaches and resource limitation in IoT design have been reported that motivate us to reconsider the QoS architectures in traditional networks. In [27], a new concept, sensing as an independent service (S2aaS), is proposed, which enables IoT to provide sensing services using mobile devices via cloud computing. In the IoT, the platform and protocol used in heterogeneous networks are signiﬁcantly depends the requirements of QoS, where the QoS attributes, such as networks availability, coverage, available bandwidth, information accuracy, and so on, span a new design space of QoS. Although a lot of QoS schemes and architecture frameworks have proposed for existing heterogeneous networks, some of the principal operational characteristics of the new wireless networks, such as WSNs, WMNs, RFID, and ad hoc networks are still only poorly understood in IoT. It is still difﬁcult to deﬁne the “quality” of the services and the “lifetime” of networks in IoT. The traditional QoS attributes are evidently inappropriate in IoT,

where the services involve many attributes such as “information accuracy” and “services availability,”. Fig. 1 shows a basic architecture of IoT that considers the new features of serviceoriented IoT.
The QoS in IoT investigates an integrate treatment of the information accuracy, coverage, energy consumption, the cost of a network deployment, and traditional QoS attributes. It is a challenging task to prove the relations among these attributes mentioned above, but characterizing principle behavior is an achievable study objective with great practical consequences.
B. QoS Architecture in IoT
As a heterogeneous complex system, in IoT, multiple communication techniques might be combined to provide continuous sensory data acquisition, transmission, processing, and storage. An IoT edge-node (e.g., RFID tag or sensor node) collects information and transmits over network layer to the service users/providers, where resource is reserved for services in a proactive manner. By optimizing services quality, network services, and end-node performance, the entire cost of a service cost is minimized.
To achieve the optimal services quality, network services, and edge-node performance is very difﬁcult. It can be modeled with a stochastic programming process by using the randomness of services in application layer. The QoS models should be able to schedule the trafﬁc from multiple sources, which depend on QoS requirements over available connections. In our three-layered QoS architecture, we model the QoS optimization problem as a Makov decision process (MDP) in application layer, which targets to maximize the services quality. In network layer, a programming method is used to minimize the connection cost and optimal network attributes. In sensing layer, the optimization object is to obtain the optimal sensing cost and usage of edgenode. This architecture for QoS decision support process is useful to provide ﬂexible and cost-effective services to users/ providers, as shown in Fig. 2. More speciﬁcally, QoS attributes are scheduled over three layers.
1) At the application layer, an application is selected to establish a connection, and the decisions are made by the user and the QoS scheduling engine. In general, QoS module must allocate network resource to services that are selected in the application layer. In some cases, the services may require substantial resources and will affect the coming services and users; therefore, it is important to properly make a decision for services selection and resources allocation.
2) At the network layer, the QoS module needs to allocate the network resources to the selected services. The decisionmaking process at this layer may involve QoS attributes that are used in traditional QoS mechanisms over networks, such as cellular, RFID, WSN, and so on.
3) At the sensing layer, the decision-making process involves selection of basic sensing infrastructure based on sensing ability and the required QoS for application/user. The QoS module at sensing layer is responsible for the selection of basic sensing devices. The decision-making process in this layer is expected to reduce the overlapping of sensing and data redundance and lower the energy consumption.

Fig. 3. QoS decision in network layer of IoT.

1) QoS in Application Layer: For services in IoT, speciﬁc QoS requirements may be requested, as well as the commonly used QoS metrics such as throughput, bandwidth, delay, and performance of the protocols in use. Many existing QoS models for traditional Internet are available for this layer, such as differentiated services (DiffServ) [22], ﬂexible QoS model for ad-hoc networks (FQMM) [23], and integrated mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) QoS (iMAQ) model [24]. In IoT, we investigate the composite QoS in the service-oriented environment. The existing QoS models did not consider the inherent stochastic and dynamic nature of IoT and may cause service failure. The QoS in application layer focuses on reliable service composition algorithms based on Markov decision, which can signiﬁcantly improve success rate of IoT service.
At the application layer, an application is selected to establish a connection, and the decisions are made by the QoS schedule engine. The main functionalities of this layer are as follows: 1) efﬁciently schedule the services according to the QoS and 2) transfer the resource requests to the QoS module in network layer of IoT.
2) QoS in Network Layer: Fig. 3 shows that the QoS module at network layer of IoT contains the allocation of network resources. The recent trends indicate that services in IoT may require the coexistence of heterogeneous networks (especially for wireless networks) to provide universal coverage and network access due to their different characteristics. However, the different sensing devices and information that acquired by them becomes increasingly difﬁcult to access and make use of over such huge networks. In IoT, services can be provided over multiple access network nodes within the same network layer technology. The service providers can provide the reserved network connections for its users to support the applications that users required. Seamless and efﬁcient QoS support from different infrastructures is a challenging problem in the applications development toward the IoT.

Fig. 4. QoS decision in sensing layer of IoT.
3) QoS in Sensing Layer: It is important for IoT to measure the QoS attributes provided by IoT, which is much different with that of traditional networks. In our works, we deﬁned the services in IoT by three levels: 1) application level; 2) network level; and 3) sensing level, as shown in Fig. 4. The services in application level and network level are same with the traditional services, which mean that the QoS support in application level and network level can be measured with traditional QoS attributes. However, the sensing level is the physical infrastructure of IoT, which includes nodes with different resources, such as powerful data process centre, sensor networks, RFID, mobile devices, and other heterogeneous devices. The availability of services in this layer determines the success or failure of a service request.
C. QoS Metrics in IoT
In QoS framework design, it is essential to measure the QoS attributes that are provided by IoT, where services are much different with that in traditional networks. Similar to the QoS optimization in tradition networks, application layer and network layer can evaluate service quality with existing QoS attributes.

LI et al.: QoS-AWARE SCHEDULING OF SERVICES-ORIENTED IoT

1501

However, at the sensing layer, the QoS metrics involve the resources allocation and information process at diverse edgenodes of IoT, such as information accuracy and availability of services is determined by the sensing layer.
1) The Application Layer: The QoS metrics used in IoT are similar to that of existing QoS in web services, where the following metrics can be used.
1) Services perform cost denotes the cost to invoke a service and is provided by the service provider, and it is a constant in a service round.
2) Perform time denotes the perform time from accepting of service to the ﬁnishing of it.
3) Load is used to evaluate the service of real-time usage. 4) Reliability denotes that the reliability of service can be
obtained to the user. 2) The Network Layer: In network layer, the network trafﬁc can be classiﬁed into two categories: 1) delay-sensitive service, such as real-time applications; and 2) BE class service, such as data-based applications. In this level, the following metrics might be involved. 1) Bandwidth allocation denotes the bandwidth that can be
allocated to connections provided for a service. 2) The capacity of network layer, which aims to achieve
maximum throughput under QoS constraints. 3) Allocation rate by taking the delay, throughput, and jitter
into consideration. 4) Power efﬁcient strategies and throughput optimization
over the network layers. 3) The Sensing Layer: In IoT, the availability of services in application layer depend the support of both network layer and sensing layer. In sensing layer, when multiple devices are available that can serve for a service request, a decision process is needed to determine the selection of sensing devices. The services in service-oriented IoT may subject to compromise of information by low sensing quality and noise. As a result, the accuracy of acquired information is a metric to measure the discrepancy between the real world and the provided result. In most sensing-based applications, a probability with which a given accuracy can be achieved is related with services, which needs to make a correct/optimal decision. On the other hand, power consumption at sensing nodes and cost are two important factors of QoS in sensing layer. Energy/power is related to the lifetime of sensing networks, and the cost is inﬂuenced by the deployment of devices. In this study, we use the information accuracy, sensing precision, energy consumption, life-time of sensing networks, and cost to measure the QoS of sensing networks, as well as a four-tuple (accuracy, precision, energy/power, lifetime, and cost).
D. QoS Monitoring Modules
It is necessary to automatically monitor the attributes of QoS in IoT. When a service arrives, it might be divided into multiple subtasks at application layer that can be executed over network layer and then further sent to the sensing layer. In network layer, the scheduler decides the network type and sensing layer devices, i.e., for data acquisition based subtasks, the scheduler will arrange the proper RFID or sensor network to execute it, the

policy can be predeﬁned before tasks distribution. At the sensing level, the QoS manager needs to optimize the cost for ﬁxed budget, i.e., selection of nodes, power consumptions, connectivity, size of largest component in a graph, etc. A decision-making process is needed to trade-off the cost-quality density. The main functionalities of QoS monitoring modules include:
1) decomposing the QoS requirements of arriving applications into requirements for individual services used in the services;
2) synthesizing descriptions of the QoS attributes among the three layers;
3) compiling the synthesized descriptions into executable subtasks.

IV. DECISION-MAKING PROCESS FOR QOS
The decisions-making in application, network, and sensing layers of IoT must be made to support the QoS requirements for different services. At the application layer, an application may contain one or more services, and the decisions are made by the application layer that depends the QoS requirements of service(s). The QoS scheduler needs to allocate resources to the services according to the QoS requirements. In some cases, the arriving services may require some substantial resources that affect the number of subtasks that can serve by the system. The decisionmaking at network layer is similar to that of the traditional QoS guarantee in existing networks, including the human factors (such as stability of service, users, delays, and so on) and technical factors (such as reliability and scalability). The decision-making at the sensing layer involves information accuracy, energy consumptions for selected networks, such as WSN, RFID, Wireless Mobile Networks or WLAN, based on the availability of resource and requirements of QoS. The decision-making at sensing layer also deals with how much users or area have been covered by the IoT, and how much cost is used for a service.

A. QoS Decision-Making Process in Application Layer

In service-oriented IoT, an application from user is always

involved to multiple services or composition of multiple services

to fulﬁl the goal. In QoS design for IoT, the service request

arrives randomly, which causes the uncertainty of services, and

the inherent stochastic and dynamic nature of services should be

considered. Actually, it is difﬁcult to dynamically update the

QoS requirements for real-time-based applications. In the QoS

decision process at application layer, a Markov decision process

(MDP) is used to model the services QoS, where some new

metrics are introduced.

1) Measurement Metrics at Application Layer of QoS: For the

services in application layer, many metrics are available for

measurement of QoS. The service cost, service time, service

load, the reliability, and the reputation are the most important

factors, which are deﬁned as follows (let denote a service in

IoT).

1) Service Cost is the cost for the services provided by

the end service provider and is a constant in IoT.

2) Service Time

denotes the service time from the

acceptance of the request to ﬁnishing of the task.

3) Load L is used to measure the usage of service in IoT,

reputation the IoT node hold.

2) QoS Architecture: In IoT, the QoS manager records the

communications between tasks and services; by doing this,

QoS manager is able to monitor the QoS metrics that can be

provided by IoT. Assume that denotes the QoS metrics

B. Decision Model in Network Layer

In network layer, the network trafﬁc can be classiﬁed into two classes depending the types of service: 1) delay or jitter sensitive service that has an expectation to deliver on time, such as real-time-based services and 2) BE class service that includes all nondetrimental services, such as peer-to-peer applications. The sensitive service requires the network layer to provide

connections with a minimum transmission rate as

for

.

The BE-based services should be able to achieve optimal

proportional fairness. Each edge-node in sensing layer obtains

the resource from the available access networks to the networked

layer. For nodes in sensing layer

and nodes in

network layer

tion and the total bandwidth and power consumption are denoted

as and , respectively. Then the throughput at node can

be modeled as

the node , can access all ; is the bandwidth allocated to

It is clear that for

In an IoT that includes heterogeneous nodes, the system capacity maximization with QoS support problem can be modeled as

in which denotes the total bandwidth at node , and is the maximum available power of node . It is clear that (13) can be solved using convex optimization method, in which the total bandwidth at each nodes in both network layer and sensing layer can be obtained.

C. Decision-Making Process for QoS in Sensing Layer

The characteristics of sensing layer include autonomous (in

which some edge-nodes are densely and randomly deployed in

an autonomous manner), limited resources (some edge-nodes of

IoT have limited resources and power supply, and are typically

small in size), susceptible (the physical environment in which the

sensing layer is deployed in out-doors and can be easily dam-

aged), and speciﬁc data-centric (the services supported by IoT

applications).

As mentioned above, in QoS design at the sensing layer

following factors should be considered: 1) the information

accuracy, which is very different from the traditional QoS

requirement due to the information in IoT suffers from informa-

tion compromise; 2) the links with high bandwidth and low cost

have priority for a service; 3) the number of connections for

services should be minimized and the communication load over

current communications should be optimized; and 4) coverage of

IoT, it depends the deployment of edge-nodes in IoT.

In this work, we highlight the following issues, information

accuracy, energy efﬁciency, adaptability, and coverage. In sens-

ing layer, the QoS performance metrics signiﬁcantly differ from

the existing QoS mechanisms and the key metrics that should be

considered in sensing layer are as follows.

1) Information accuracy: Each node might be deployed

separately to efﬁciently sense interested data. It includes

the data accuracy, sensing time accuracy, and spatial

accuracy. In order to reduce the data redundancy and

transmission burden, data collected from different IoT

edge-nodes might be packed into a packet which then will

be forwarded to up layers.

2) Energy consumption: In IoT, the energy limitation of end

sensing nodes is of crucial importance to the lifetime of the

sensing nodes.

3) Coverage: The diversity of applications in IoT might led to

interpretation of IoT coverage which targets to sure each

sensing region in within the sensing range of at least one

sensor node.

The information accuracy can be quantiﬁed with probability:

a larger probability means a higher accuracy. Let random vari-

able

The coverage of node is difﬁcult to deﬁne in IoT, since in IoT the coverage may involve sensing area or business events, in this model we use to represent the coverage level.
Therefore, an optimal QoS requirement needs to maximize all the three parameters, and it can be described as
V. SIMULATION
In order to verify the proposed QoS mechanism, in this section we simulate the QoS scheduling for multiple services in an IoT with 100 sensor nodes. The service requests are randomly arrived according to a normal distribution, and the simulation environment is as follows: Intel i3 CPU 2.3 GHz, 4G RAM, Windows 7, and MATLAB 2009R. To evaluate the QoS service scheduling ability in application layer, we simulate 10 and 20 services in an IoT environment. Fig. 5 depicts the mean values for the services that successfully served rate when the number of IoT nodes

varies from 10 to 20, and a total of 100 trails are simulated for

each setting. It can be seen that the proposed scheme can

effectively improve the service accurate. In Fig. 6, we investigate

the information accuracy when a data acquisition application is

served in IoT. It is shown that the error between the acquired data

and the real data remains near to 5% when the number of IoT

nodes is small than 13 for both 10 and 20 services are scheduled,

but increases quickly when the services number increases be-

yond 17. In Fig. 7, we investigate the energy consumption of IoT

network with 100 nodes. When 10 data acquisition services are

invoked, the proposed decision scheme can signiﬁcantly reduce

the energy consumption at IoT nodes. When no QoS scheduler is

performed, the ﬁrst dead node occurred at time

, mean-

while the ﬁrst dead node occurrence time is

when QoS

scheduler is performed. The lifetime of IoT is signiﬁcantly

prolonged.

Meanwhile, the energy consumption and network costs varies

slightly as the services number, which suggests that the QoS

in network layer and sensing layer tend to provide optimal

solutions.

VI. CONCLUSION
It is foreseeable that the IoT will be a part of future internet where “things” can be wirelessly organized as a global network
that can provide dynamic services for applications and users. IoT
is able to bridge the gap between the virtual network and the real
things world. As reported in [26], [27], the edge-nodes of service-
oriented IoT may be able to interact and communication with the
environment and work cooperatively in business, information,
and social process. This works focus on the QoS support for the diverse applications in IoT. We ﬁrstly investigated the existing
QoS mechanisms in different networks that are involved in IoT,
and then examined the constraints in IoT. We also proposed a
three-layer architecture which aims to enhance the QoS in IoT.
This framework includes the application layer, network layer,
and the sensing layer. The QoS optimization algorithms also have been given, depending on the speciﬁc service requirements.
