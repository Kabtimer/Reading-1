Spreading Factor Allocation for Massive Connectivity in LoRa Systems

Jin-Taek Lim and Youngnam Han

Abstract—Along with enhanced mobile broadband and ultrareliable low latency communication, massive connectivity has been one of the key requirements for enabling technologies of 5G. For IoT, low power consumption and wide area coverage for end devices (ED) are important ﬁgures of merit, for which LoRa, SigFox and Narrow Band-IoT are dominant technologies. In this letter, we analyze LoRa systems for increasing average system packet success probability (PSP) under unslotted ALOHA random access protocol. The lower bound for average system PSP is derived when many contending EDs are transmitting by stochastic geometry. And it is shown that the average system PSP can be maximized by properly allocating an SF to each trafﬁc, which also maximizes connectivity of EDs. We formulate an optimization problem for maximizing the average system PSP to propose a sub-optimal SF allocation scheme to each trafﬁc. Analysis on PSP is validated through simulations, and comparison with existing schemes reveals that our proposed scheme achieves the highest PSP and so the maximum connectivity.

I. INTRODUCTION
T HE INTERNET of Things (IoT) is widely adopted in such areas as home automation, u-Health and environment. In IoT, it is essential that things can communicate with their surroundings widely and collect or transmit information with low power consumption, for which Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) network technologies are proposed. However, LPWA technologies achieve the objectives through the tradeoff with low data rate (typically in orders of tens of kilobits per seconds) and higher latency (typically in orders of seconds or minutes). Up to date, three technologies are proposed for those use cases of low-power, delay tolerant and low rate transmissions, Narrow Band (NB)-IoT, LoRa and SigFox. These technologies have many different features, and especially differ in that NB-IoT adopts licensed band with existing infrastructure, while as LoRa and SigFox adopt unlicensed band requiring new infrastructure for service.
Lots of work have been carried on for the effect on the coverage by analyzing the interference. The signal activity and power levels for LoRa and SigFox are measured for the European Industrial, Scientiﬁc, and Medical band (863-870 MHz) in the city of Aalborg, Denmark [2]. The coverage and capacity of SigFox and LoRaWAN in a large scale urban environments have been analyzed [3]. Moreover, the coverage of GPRS, NB-IoT, LoRa, and SigFox is compared in a realistic scenario by simulation [4]. Especially for LoRa, a mathematical analysis on its coverage was conducted in [5] via stochastic geometry [6]. However, a little work has been done to maximize the massive connectivity which is another important feature for LPWA IoT.

In LoRa, the Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation technique [1] is proposed, which is a kind of spread spectrum multiple access techniques accommodating multiple users in a single channel. It is known that the CSS modulation achieves low receiver sensitivities making long range communications possible. Also, it is known that CSS interference comes mostly from the same-spreading factor (SF) signals, and has a pseudoorthogonal characteristic with the different-SF signals [1]. In order to analyze the massive connectivity, we must consider low receiver sensitivities and interferences of CSS modulation.
We investigated the massive connectivity in LoRa and proposed a sub-optimal SF allocation method by considering the effects of same/different-SF interference under unslotted ALOHA protocol. First, we derived the average system PSP by the well-known stochastic geometry. Then, realizing that massive connectivity can be achieved by maximizing average system PSP, we formulate an optimization problem and proposed an SF allocation scheme.
The rest of this letter is organized as follows. Section II brieﬂy introduces LoRa system. Analysis on PSP and problem formulation are provided in Section III. Performance evaluations and discussions are presented in Section IV. Conclusions are made in Section V.
II. SYSTEM MODEL

We consider an uplink LoRa system as shown in Fig. 1a

where N EDs are distributed in a single cell. EDs are located

from a homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP) Φ on the

Euclidean plane cell radius and

R2 N¯

with

intensity

λ

=

N¯ RC2

,

is the mean of Poisson

where RC is the random variable

N. Each ED selects an SF s and transmits a packet, where

s (∈ S = {1, 2, ..., 6} and S = |S|) is the index assigned

for corresponding SF in Tab I. And these EDs compete with

each other through unslotted ALOHA random access protocol

within a given contention time Tc.

Collision overlap time (ts,s ) in unslotted ALOHA: To

model the interference caused by collisions, we deﬁne the

collision overlap time ts,s (Fig. 1b) between the packets of

SF s and s and derive its probability density function (PDF).

ls is the length of packet with SF s, s ∈ S. Because LoRa assumes unslotted ALOHA protocol, ts,s does not depend on

which EDs are transmitting, but on its packet durations. Also,

in unslotted ALOHA, each ED with SF s randomly chooses

its transmission start time ts, where ts ∼ U(0, Tc = (Tc − ls)) for contention window, Tc. Here, we can assume that Tc Tc

because Tc is sufﬁciently longer than ls. If we deﬁne ∆t as

the time difference between the transmission start times of two

colliding packets of SF s and s (i.e., ∆t = ts − ts ), the PDF

of ∆t can be derived as f∆t (t) = max

f∆t (t), we can get the pdf of ts,s (see Fig. 1b, where ls < ls

and ts < ts < ts + ls ). Assuming that ls is shorter than ls

(Since, for ls > ls , it can be seen as symmetric case with ls

and ls interchanged, we provide analysis for this case), we

can derive the distribution of ts,s from f∆t (t) as follows

where δ(·) is the Dirac-delta function. In (1), the ﬁrst term on

the righthand side is for the event when there is no collision

and the second term comes from the observation that the

packet with smaller SF s is included in the packet of larger

SF s packet. The last two terms are for the case when the

packets overlap each other in t.

SIR model: The reference packet to be decoded has multi-

ple SIRs from Is for each s (Is , a set of interfering EDs of SF s , s ∈ S). Then, we deﬁne the SIR of packet with SF s

interfering with Is as

γs,s =

where P is the transmit power of each ED, g (or gk) is the Rayleigh fading channel between gateway (GW) and ED located at r (or interfering ED k), A0 = c/4π f which comes from the Friis transmission equation with the carrier frequency f , c is the light velocity and α is the path loss exponent. And,

r (rk) is the distance between the GW and ED (interfering ED

k). The packets are not synchronized under unslotted ALOHA,

The reason behind this is that if the channel coding make

use of an interleaver, the interfering energy between colliding

packets can be spread out.

SF Allocation in LoRa [5]: In order for the received

packet with SF s to be successfully decoded in a GW, its

received power must exceed a receiver sensitivity qs (condition I) and its signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) contaminated by the interference with packets of SF s (s ∈ S), γs,s , must also exceed the relative threshold Ts,s (condition II) for all s , simultaneously (Ts,s is given by the element of T in [1] which is the threshold matrix of LoRa).

In LoRa, the chirp symbol duration can be expressed as Ts = 2SF /BW [1], where SF is a spreading factor and BW is bandwidth. Ts doubles for every increase in SF. As a result, a packet length ls, which is multiples of Ts, has a different value for each SF s. Actually, an increase in packet duration for a chirp gives the message higher robustness to noise, resulting in a low required signal-to-noise ratio threshold. For each SF s, receiver sensitivity qs = −174+10 log10 B + N F + SN Rs where the constant (-174 dBm) is the thermal noise density, and N F is the noise ﬁgure margin at GW (6 dB). A typical example for system parameters is provided in Tab. I when B = 125 KHz and 25 byte message [5].
From qs, we can deduce that the SF to satisfy qs gets smaller as the ED gets closer to the GW. In other words, the farther the ED is from the GW, the higher SF the ED should be allocated to. It means that there are boundaries which is determined from the receiver sensitivity (condition I). This results in the predeﬁned SF allocation intervals [ds, ds+1] shown in Fig. 1a. However, the amount of interference is also related to these intervals, the intervals should be determined adaptively considering condition II. To be speciﬁc, the increase in the number of long messages could cause higher probability of collision between packets due to the increase in the longer interval of high SF messages, causing severe same/differentSF interferences. So, for EDs, it is important to assign a proper [ds, ds+1] to meet both conditions.
III. PROBLEM FORMULATION

The massive connectivity can be deﬁned as the average

number of EDs which meet condition I and condition II; P A0gr−α ≥ qs and γs,s ≥ Ts,s for all s . Then, massive

connectivity can be mathematically written as (3) where

IA(x) is an indicator function, fg,Is,s (x, i) is the joint pdf of

random variables g and Is,s ,

fR(r) =

2r RC2

and P[SF

=

s|r]

is the probability that ED located at r will send a packet

with SF s. is the ’intersection’ of sets. (a) holds since

And,

(b)

holds

because

of

the

fact that the choice of SF is determined from the predeﬁned

interval [ds, ds+1]. Therefore, P[SF = s|r] is 1 in [ds, ds+1],

and 0 otherwise.

Then, the average system PSP over all EDs, PSP, can

Since

to maximizing massive connectivity.

Average System PSP:

And, PSPs(r) can be expressed as follows

(5)

Inequality (a) is due to the fact that the conditioned probability

is greater than the unconditioned probability because the given

condition limits the minimum value of the numerator in γs,s for all s . Inequality (b) holds due to Fortuin, Kastelynm,

Ginibre (FKG) inequality [8]. For that, we need the following

deﬁnitions.

For the PPP, let ω = (a1, a2, ..., an, ...) for n ∈ N, and an = 1 if E Dn is active and an = 0 otherwise. Then ω ω if an ≥ an, ∀n. From (2), γs,s decreases as the number of interfering EDs increases, i.e., γs,s (ω) ≤ γs,s (ω ) if ω ω. Thus, the event {γs,s ≥ Ts,s } for each SF s is a decreasing event [7], since if ω ∈ {γs,s ≥ Ts,s } and ω ω, then ω ∈ {γs,s ≥ Ts,s }. In other words, these events
are positively correlated (i.e., The likelihood of each of these

events being true decreases when ω increases and increases

when ω decreases). Hence, by applying FKG inequality for

these events, we can get the lower bound of condition II.

To evolve the last line of (5), we should derive the SIR

Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) for

each s , which can be written as

So, we can obtain the closed form for Ets,s [·] applying the PDF (1) of ts,s , which results in (9). With (9), the integral of (8) has the general solution which can be solved by using an analytical solver, such as Mathematica. Then, by substituting (8) into (6), and then into (5) with P[P A0gr−α ≥ qs |r] = exp(−qsrα/P A0), the lower bound of (4) can be obtained. However, it is not possible to get the closed-form for (4), so the
Riemann summation can be adopted for numerical calculation. Optimization problem and solution: In this subsection, we
propose an algorithm to determine [ds, ds+1] maximizing (4). We start from (5) because the difference between (4) and a
lower bound (5) is small, which will be veriﬁed. In order
to make (5) tractable, we made the following assumptions.
The different-SF interference is ignored. Moreover, only the probability event when ts,s = 0, which is the largest portion due to large Tc, is considered in (1). We use the approximation, exp(−x) (1 − x) for small x. With approximations, we can
formulate the following optimization problem :

subject to ds ≤ ds+1, ∀s ∈ S, where d1 = δ and dS+1 = RC are ﬁxed values (δ is set to avoid the singular point in path

loss model). The ﬁrst bracket within the summation of (10)

is for condition I. In the second bracket (i.e., condition II

probability), we can deduce that one interfering ED reduces

We conjecture that

comes from the uniform random choice

of slots in unslotted ALOHA protocol. Therefore, maximizing

PSP corresponds to determining SF regions and so allocating

SFs to each ED.

If α is not an integer, (10) becomes a nonlinear program-

ming (NLP) problem with the bounded variation. Although the

complexity is high with multiple variables, this problem can

be solved with a global optimization solver, such as multilevel

coordinate search (MCS) in MATLAB or MathOptimizer and

Global optimization packages of Mathematica.

And, the proposed method can be implemented as follows.

ED periodically sends its location and uplink channel infor-

mation to a GW, with a long interval. Then the GW allocates

SF to each ED by the proposed SF allocation, which will be

updated with the next channel report. It might have a limitation

because EDs periodically send information to the GW, which

requires more power and complexity, but negligible compared to other schemes. And the proposed scheme is also beneﬁcial to for long-term changes in the channel.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
We make simulations for performance comparison, where path loss exponent is assumed to be 2.7 (suburban scenario), f is assumed to be 867 MHz (for LoRa in Europe), the average number of EDs varies from 100 to 1000, and EDs are distributed within a single GW coverage of radius RC = 45 km. The transmit power for each ED was 14 dBm and Tc is set to 60 sec. The other parameters are provided as in Tab. I. For the performance comparison, we adopted 3 other existing schemes such as;
• Equal-Interval-Based (EIB) scheme [5] which determine the intervals [ds, ds+1], according to (ds+1 − ds) = RC /S,
• Equal-Area-Based (EAB) scheme which determine the intervals [ds, ds+1], based on ds = RC (s − 1)/S that makes the areas of doughnuts equal.
• Random scheme which allocates SFs by uniform random choice, not depending on the location of the ED.
The allocation intervals for proposed, EIB and EAB scheme are shown in Fig. 2. From Fig. 2, it can be said that, as N increases, it get more difﬁcult for each ED to satisfy condition II, so the proposed scheme makes the lowest SF region larger to reduce collisions. In other words, when N is large, it is more advantageous for maximizing PSP to increase the probability for condition II than to increase the probability for condition I.
Monte Carlo simulations and numerical analysis results are presented in Fig. 3 for the validation of the lower bound of (5). The gap between the numerically calculated lower bound in (4) and simulation lies within an acceptable bound, conﬁrming that the overall performance of LoRa can be analyzed through the derived lower bound. Also, this tight bound means that each event considered in (5) is almost independent.
From Fig. 3, we can make the following discussions. First, we can conﬁrm that EIB scheme works worse than Random scheme because condition II becomes difﬁcult to be satisﬁed when N increases. In case of EAB scheme when EDs were equally allocated in each SF region, the inﬂuence of interferences can be reduced to some extent, resulting in better performance than Random and EIB schemes. The proposed scheme is superior to all other schemes in terms of massive connectivity because both conditions are considered. From simulations with N¯ = 2000, the proposed method can provide stable 810 EDs satisfying both conditions, which is about 22% increase in massive connectivity over EAB. These results are based on the active EDs only, so the total number of EDs served during the contention period will be large by the inverse of activity factor.

V. CONCLUSIONS
We formulated an optimization problem to maximize average system PSP when each ED attempts to transmit uplink under unslotted ALOHA via stochastic geometry. We proposed an adaptive SF allocation algorithm and provided performance comparison with 4 other SF assigning schemes in Section IV. It was observed and conﬁrmed that our proposed allocation was superior to other methods through simulations.
