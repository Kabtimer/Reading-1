Millions of sensors, self-organizing, selfconfiguring, with QoS-based multipath routing, mobility, and …

Link budget example!
q  Received Power (dBm) = Transmitted Power (dBm) + Gains (dB) − Losses (dB)
q  Example
q  Transmitted power is +14dBm (25mw) q  Losses (FSPL) is 120dB (received power is 1012 less than
transmitted power) q  Then Receiver Power (dBm) is -106dBm
q  If you have a receiver sensitivity of -137dBm you can handle FSPL up to 151dB, i.e. 1.15x1015 less power than transmitted power!
q  Rewriting the equation
q  Losses (dB) = Transmitted Power (dBm) - Received Power (dBm) q  Losses = link budget & Received Power = max receiver sensitivity q  Link budget = Transmitted Power - max receiver sensitivity q  151dB=14dBm - (-137dBm)

Increasing range?!
q Generally, robustness and sensitivity can be increased when transmitting (much) slower
q  A[Sigfox message is sent relatively slowly in a very narrow band of spectrum (hence ultranarrow-band) using Gaussian Frequency-Shift Keying modulation]
q LoRa also increases time-on-air when maximum range is needed. But LoRa uses spread spectrum instead of UNB

What about the throughput?!

Sigfox uses ultranarrow band (UNB) of about 100Hz with GMSK (~BPSK)
Typical throughput is about 100bps
Devices can typically send up to 140 messages of 12bytes per day (operator limits)

LoRa modulation is more versatile, using CSS variant
Sensitivity and throughput depend on 3 LoRa parameters: BW (bandwidth), CR (coding rate) and SF (spreading factor)
Throughput range is 240bps to 37500bps

LoRa’s parameters!

q  Parameters

q Bandwidth: 62.5kHz, 125kHz, 250kHz, 500kHz

q Rate code: 4/4+CR (CR=1, 2, 3, 4) q Spreading factor: 6 to 12

Sensitivity: lowest input power with acceptable link quality, typically 1% PER

Rule of thumb
6dB increase = twice the range in LOS
12dB needed for urban areas

LoRa vs Sigfox!

Figure from SigFox

Figure from Semtech

Usual (ultra) narrow-band (UNB) vs spread spectrum (SS) arguments
UNB has lower in-band receive noise and SigFox can have more channels than LoRa But UNB needs tighter receiver synchronization and more complex signal processing at receiver (SigFox
uses advanced SDR at receiver to analyse the total band) SS can more rapidly be saturated so LoRa may have more interference issues in dense environments

From networking guys perspective, LoRa is more versatile with possibility to build ad-hoc mesh networ2ks6

The ISM/SRD License-Free Frequency Bands!
38	


License-free Sub-GHz constraints!
q  Shared medium so long-range transmission in dense environments can create lots of interference!
q  Activity time is constrained from 0.1%, 1% 10% duty-cycle depending on frequency: 3.6s, 36s/hour to 360s/hour
For SigFox, the operator typically limits the number of messages per day (140) with penalty for over usage. e.g. new messages/ day = 140 – (2 * « #msg_overuse») applied during «#msg_overuse» days
39	


LBT+AFA!
q Listen Before Talk and Adaptive Frequency Agility can relax the duty-cycle constraints…
q … but still
q 100s / hour on every 200kHz BW q no more than 1s for a single transmission 
q … so may not be that interesting!
41	


What about reliability?!
q Using the g3 band, 10% duty cycle can be achieved for the gateway on the downlink
q However, handling ACKs for a large number of devices is not possible
q SigFox uses repeatition
q LoRa uses coding gain (with the coding rate) and spread spectrum higher immunity to interferences
q ACKs may be reserved for critical transactions 42

What about Quality of Service?!
Regulations stipulate that radio activity duty-cycle should be enforced at devices and that end-users should not be able to modify it « easily ».
LoRaWAN specification from LoRa Alliance is a first attempt to standardize LoRa networks but no issues on quality of service.

What if I still need to send more than 36s in the current hour because of an emergency situation?

Other issues to take into account!

q  Minimise the number of UPDT messages sent by the gateway because

the gateway’s radio time is also limited

q  UPDT can have cumulative behavior if no remote activity time has been used

q  Support sleep periods of end-devices

q  The network is synchronized for control messages (REG, INIT, UPDT). UPDT msg that can not use cumulative behavior are queued for transmission at next

transmission slot. At rcv, UPDT have to be applied sequentially.

q  Maintain (loose) synchronization

q  If no UDPT are scheduled, the gateway periodically sends a BEACON. Clock drift is limited to a BEACON period

q  Dynamic insertion of new end-devices

q  New devices can either stay out of the managed pool (then only 36s of activity time/h is allowed), or join by waiting for the next UPDT/BEACON msg

q  Every hour, end-devices decide if they want to join the pool or not

q  Give priority to control msg

q  SIFS/DIFS mechanism are implemented using LoRa Channel Activity Detection

q  Avoid interleaving of several image transmissions

q  Use DIFS for first image packet, then SIFS

q  Improve LoRa network efficiency

q  Move from pure ALOHA to CSMA mechanism with CAD+RSSI tests prior to any

transmission

Conclusions!
q  Low-power, long-range (LR) transmission is a break-through technology for IoT and large-scale deployment of wireless (sensor) devices
q  With a large variety of applications, products & actors the low-power WAN (LPWAN) eco-system is becoming mature
q  New technologies will certainly emerge but the LPWAN « philosophy » is now settled firmly: out-of-the-box connectivity is now the standard.
q  Is multi-hop routing for low-power device still interesting in the IoT domain?
q  Mostly driven by industrials, research & development around long-range technologies should also attract the academic research community
