Abstract—Extending cloud infrastructure to the Network Edge represents a breakthrough to support delay-sensitive applications in next 5G cellular systems. In this context, to enable ultrashort response times, fast relocation of service instances between edge nodes is required to cope with user mobility. To face this issue, proactive service replication is considered a promising strategy to reduce the overall migration time and to guarantee the desired Quality of Experience (QoE). On the other hand, the provisioning of replicas over multiple edge nodes increases the resource consumption of constrained edge nodes and the relevant deployment cost. Given the two conﬂicting objectives, in this paper we investigate diﬀerent optimization models for proactive service migration at the Network Edge, which can exploit prediction of user mobility patterns. In particular, we deﬁne two Integer Linear Problem optimization schemes, which aim at respectively minimizing the QoE degradation due to service migration, and the cost of replicas’ deployment. Performance evaluation shows the eﬀectiveness of our proposed solutions.
I. Introduction
Over the last years both network and cloud research communities have greatly focused on the development of eﬃcient frameworks to extend the cloud from remote data-centers to the network edge [1]. This approach could increase the support of real-time cloud applications with strict requirements in terms of latency, such as mobile gaming, augmented reality, and Tactile Internet [2]. To promote the wide adoption of edge infrastructure, several industrial organizations are working to deﬁne standards and enable interoperability, such as ETSI Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) [3] and Open Fog Consortium [4]. However, manifold challenges still remain open.
In a distributed edge environment, a key issue is represented by user mobility, which may cause signiﬁcant Quality of Experience (QoE) degradation, even in small scenarios, as reported in [5]. Indeed, when a user moves under the coverage of a diﬀerent edge node, he is forced to access the service instance running in the previous serving edge node for the total migration time, i.e., the time required to migrate the service instance in the attached edge node. Since the links between edge nodes usually present high latency, forwarding the request to another edge node can notably increase service response time, and so drastically reduce the user QoE.
To enable fast migration of application instances between edge nodes, service replication mechanism can be adopted [6]. Indeed, the proactive deployments of relevant application replicas in near edge nodes can make the migration seamless to the end user, who will connect to a ready replica instance

after moving to a diﬀerent serving edge node. This approach can be especially promising for novel applications based on microservice architecture, which relies on moving application states into back-end data systems [7] [8] [9]. As investigated in [10] [11], proactive service migration solutions for containerbased applications present several beneﬁts compared to classic reactive migration systems. By enabling appropriate synchronization between back-end storage and thus providing fast access to on-demand state, extremely low-latency interaction between the processing service and relevant data store allows for guaranteeing adequate application performance. However, service replication involves additional cost of deployment in terms of processing and storage resources for the replicas allocation, and bandwidth for guaranteeing periodical synchronization between relevant replicas. Accounting also that edge nodes are typically resource constrained, appropriate optimization schemes should be adopted to enable an eﬃcient use of the service replication mechanism, especially for 5G cloud-based cellular systems.
In this paper, we formulate the problem of proactive migration approach in cellular 5G networks. Furthermore, by leveraging on prediction schemes of user mobility patterns, we propose analytic models based on Integer Linear Problem optimization to enhance the proactive migration of applications in a multi-edge environment. In particular, we deﬁne two solutions aiming at minimizing, on the one hand, the QoE degradation due to service migration, and on the other hand, the cost of proactive replication. Finally, we evaluate the proposed schemes accounting for diﬀerent conﬁgurations in MEC scenarios.
This paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we browse relevant related work. In Section III, we discuss the reference system model for service migration, whereas the problem formulation is deﬁned in Section IV. The proposed optimization solutions are described in Section V. Performance evaluation is presented in Section VI, while conclusive remarks are given in the last section.
II. Related work
Nowadays, migration of service instances represents an essential functionality in cloud distributed infrastructures [12]. Diﬀerent techniques for live migration of VMs in data-centers have been developed, such as Pre-Copy and Post-Copy memory migration [13]. Several research works have been also

conducted to extend live VM migration over distributed cloud data-centers. In [5], a speciﬁc VM handoﬀ method has been proposed for MEC environment to tolerate the high variability of cloudlets. Despite the remarkable eﬀorts, the results still present signiﬁcant values of total migration times, which could cause a notable degradation of QoE in MEC environment, since degraded end-to-end latency persists until the end of the operation.
The service replication approaches have been highly studied in the literature for VMs to support high availability (HA) [14]. Furthermore, CloudSpider [6] proposes combining VM replication with VM scheduling to reduce migration times due to the transfer of large VM image over low bandwidth WAN (Wide Area Network) links. Our approach is also focused on novel microservices applications and containerbased virtualization [15] [16], which cope better with the limitation of resource-constrained edge nodes.
Another relevant area of research deals with Application Content Delivery Network at the edge [17], [18], [19], which investigates the deployment of web services in diﬀerent edge servers, by distributing both service code and dynamic content. Whereas our study addresses real-time replication of services based on single user migration, these research work focus on the data management, since concurrent accesses could corrupt data consistency between the web servers.
Furthermore, in cellular systems, channel reservation schemes and models have been highly investigated to reduce the probability of dropped calls during user handovers [20]. To this aim, a number of channels is reserved to ensure the priority of successful handover calls. However, these available channels can be exploited interchangeably by the users which move to the same cell. This diﬀers from our MEC scenario whereby each deployed application instance is strictly associated to a single user, accounting for the relevant data and state. Therefore, the replicas deployed in the near edge nodes are reserved only for the user which has requested the related service.
III. Service migration in MEC Environment
To meet the strict latency requirements of real-time applications [2], such as Tactile Internet, mobile gaming, and augmented reality, moving the deployment of user applications at the network edge will play a key role in next-generation cellular networks. However, the mobility of users between diﬀerent edge nodes will introduce new challenges for cloudbased Telco infrastructure [21]. In this section, we consider diﬀerent service migration solutions for MEC-based applications to meet the desired QoE.
A. Reactive approach
A classic reactive approach requires the migration of a service instance between diﬀerent edge nodes following the mobility of its respective user. In particular, when a user moves out from the coverage area of a serving edge node (hereinafter referred to as source edge), the MEC framework needs to ﬁrst locate the most suitable target edge (i.e., both

in terms of geographical proximity and resource availability) to accommodate the migrating service. Once the target edge is selected, the procedure of migration for user application is performed, according to the type of application and the relevant underlying virtualization technology [22].
It is worth noticing that, in MEC environment, service continuity is not only related to the downtime (i.e., the time when the application instance is interrupted to perform the ﬁnal phase of service migration), but also to the overall total migration time, which drastically impacts the user’s desired QoE. Indeed, until the completion of the migration process, the user needs to interact with the serving instance in the source edge and the relevant round-trip time may exceed the tolerable delay.
B. Proactive approach
To support ultra-short latency applications, we consider proactive migration in a MEC cellular environment. The basic idea is to guarantee fast relocation by deploying multiple replicas of the user service in neighboring edge nodes, so to make services readily available if handover to a diﬀerent cloudlet is necessary. In this way, the long migration time required by on-demand service relocation could be drastically reduced.
However, the proposed approach introduces additional cost per each user service. First, the replication mechanism must reserve enough resources, in terms of computation, memory, and networking to guarantee the execution of the service replicas according to the required Service Level Agreement (SLA). Moreover, the system is required to provide a synchronization system, which manages the periodical propagation of state updates between replicas. This aspect involves further cost in terms of bandwidth to deploy replicated service instances in order to guarantee periodical data synchronization.
An optimized planning of service replicas, by carefully selecting the number and location in a cellular environment, could drastically reduce the overall cost. Indeed, when considering a traditional cellular cluster topology, a naive approach is represented by distributing replicas in all edges nearby the serving cloudlet. However, this approach involves two drawbacks. On the one hand, there is a risk of wasting reserved resources in edge nodes which the user will never connect to; on the other hand, there is the risk to overload cloudlets with replicas when a large number of user requires delay-sensitive services (thus reducing the number of new eﬀective services deployed due to lack of available resources). As a possible solution to reduce the impact of service replication, precise estimation of user mobility pattern can drastically reduce the cost of replica deployment. For instance, by exploiting information about user position and orientation, the system could perform simple predictions of future user path and replicate services only at the target edges towards the user mobility direction. In this way, the number of involved edge nodes could be almost halved. More advanced prediction of user mobility patterns can be developed by exploiting a mobile service usage cartography based on ﬁltered historical movements [23] and leveraging

Let hu(i) denote the probability of handovers to a near edge node ENi for the u-th user. Indeed, for each user a mobility proﬁle could be deﬁned, to estimate its movements with good precision. Furthermore, let us deﬁne a matrix P(u, n), which maps the user to the ENs according to the deployment of the relevant service instances. In this phase, we could assume that primary service instance and relevant replicas are equivalent.
The problem of managing replication management, such that both (i) the QoE degradation, i.e., the probability of reactive migrations, and (ii) the cost of replicas deployment are minimized, can be formulated according to the following linear program model:

Fig. 1. Example deployment of proactive migration based on replication.
big data techniques [24]. For instance, in vehicular urban environment, highly accurate estimation of handover events along the path to destination can be modeled by accounting for the time taken to transit road segments along the path, navigation zone characteristics, and behaviour of users on speciﬁc road segments. Therefore, by integrating model able to predict the user path from source to destination [25], the MEC system could evaluate if enough resources can be reserved in the cloudlets along the user route, in order to enable extremely fast handover between the selected edge nodes and guarantee the desired QoE.
In Fig. 1, an exemplary scenario of replicas deployment for a typical cellular cluster is depicted. We assume that the user is under the coverage of edge node EN1 and a relevant user application is running in EN1. According to the probability of handover in nearby cells, service replicas of the same user’s application are deployed in edge nodes EN2, EN3, EN4, and EN5. If the user moves to one of these edge nodes, fast service migration is guaranteed by the proactive approach, whereas if user moves to either EN6 and EN7 a reactive migration is required.
IV. Problem formulation
Let us assume that the MEC system is composed of a set of N Edge Nodes (ENs), named N, where each EN is referred with an index 1 < n < N. Let deﬁne the population of U users, named U, that are in the MEC environment. Let us assume that each user requires only one service. Each primary instance of user application is executed in the edge node which the user is connected to. Indeed, we underline that the proposed model is designed for extremely delay-sensitive applications. This involves that the service should be deployed in the nearest EN, to guarantee the desired ultra-short latency.

The ﬁrst objective aims to minimize the probability of reactive migration between diﬀerent ENs. This objective can be satisﬁed by deploying additional service replicas only in edge nodes where the user is likely going to move to. The second goal aims at reducing the number of cost related to proactive service migration, i.e., the number of service replicas. Furthermore, the following constraints should be respected:

1) Constraint 1 ensures that the matrix P is binary, ∀u ∈ U. 2) Constraint 2 guarantees that the primary instance of each
user’s application is deployed in iu, i.e., the edge node which the u-th user is connected to. 3) Constraint 3 accounts for the limited resources of ENs, which can host a maximum number of service instances equal to INS T ANCES MAX.

V. Optimization Models for Replication-based Service Migration
We present two optimization solutions in order to resolve the multi-objectives problem described in the previous Section. The result of both solutions is represented by the matrix P, which provides decisions about the service deployment. The ﬁrst solution is designed to support the highest QoE for mobile 5G applications with strict latency requirements at the network edge. In particular, it aims to minimize the reactive migrations for applications deployed in MEC system by exploiting replication mechanism, while guaranteeing that the number of service replicas does not overcome a speciﬁc threshold for each user. The second solution is proposed to minimize the cost of proactive service migration, while supporting the desired user QoE.

A. Min-RM: Minimizing Reactive Migration with Service Replication
Let RM denote the function that we aim at optimizing to achieve the highest user QoE. This function RM can be formally deﬁned as the maximum probability of reactive migrations that can be tolerated in the MEC system for ultra-short delay critical applications. Furthermore, let REPLICAS MAX deﬁne the maximum number of deployable replicas for each activated service, which directly relates to the cost of replication mechanism each user is willing to sustain. If no limitation is imposed in terms of replication cost, then REPLICAS MAX could be set to ∞. In this case, the optimal solution for the user u-th would converge to deploying a replica in all edges nearby the current serving cloudlets, if required resources are available in the MEC systems. The optimization model to minimize reactive migration by exploiting service replication can be formulated according to the following linear program:

minimize RM

s.t.

∀u ∈ U, ∀i ∈ N, P(u, i) ∈ {0, 1}

∀u ∈ U, P(u, iu) = 1

∀i ∈ N, P(u, i) ≤ INS T ANCES MAX

∀u ∈ U, P(u, i) ≤ REPLICAS MAX

hu(i)(1 − P(u, i)) ≤ RM

B. Min-NSR: Minimizing Number of Service Replicas for Proactive Migration

Similar to the previous solution, let NSR denote the function we aim at optimizing to reduce the number of service replicas and, therefore, the overall cost of service replication. Formally, we deﬁne NSR the maximum number of service replicas which could be deployed for each user application in the system. On the other hand, we set the maximum threshold of reactive migrations T RMMAX, which is allowed to guarantee the desired user QoE. The optimization model to minimize the cost of service replication can be formulated according to the following linear program:

minimize NSR

s.t.

∀u ∈ U, ∀i ∈ N, P(u, i) ∈ {0, 1}

∀u ∈ U, P(u, iu) = 1

∀u ∈ U, hu(i)(1 − P(u, i)) ≤ T RMMAX

VI. Performance Evaluation

To evaluate our proposed optimal solutions, we developed a simulator in Python, based on the Gurobi optimization

framework [26]. The Gurobi Optimizer is an engine used by over 1500 companies and academic institutions to implement and solve complex mathematical models. The MEC simulation environment considers a mobile network composed of edge nodes, equi-spatially distributed in a grid topology over a small urban area of [1000, 1000] m. The edge nodes are interconnected through X2 LTE channels and can be represented by LTE eNodeB, whose radius coverage is around 250 meters for micro cells deployment. For our analysis we consider eNodeB enhanced with small-scale cloud capabilities and we consider a scenario where all the involved users require the same typology of service. This assumption is compliant with the emerging paradigm of network slicing [27], according to which deﬁnite amount of computing, storage, and networking resources are allocated to support the requirements of speciﬁc verticals in the edge-enhanced Telco network. In this context, we assume each EN can host a limited number of users’ instances, e.g., 30, related to a particular vertical. We account for a varying number of users and, for each user, the MEC system is able to estimate the probability of handover in a near edge node, by using mobility prediction algorithms, such as [24], [23]. The handover probabilities to near edge nodes are dynamically stored for the i-th user in the relevant hu(i) matrix. In this way, the optimization solutions can analyze and decide the service replica deployment on-demand, according to the last registered user position and to the up-to-date handover probabilities. Furthermore, we assume that only one service is associated to each user. The proposed algorithms are evaluated in terms of the following two metrics:
• Probability of user reactive migration: it accounts for the QoE degradation, depending on the probability of reactive migration when a user moves to a nearby edge node.
• Average number of replicas per user: it is deﬁned as the average number of service replicas deployed for each user service in the near edge nodes. This parameter allows for characterizing the cost of proactive replication-based migration.
In the ﬁrst analysis, we have compared the two proposed optimization solutions as a function of the number of users, as reported in Fig. 2. Each plotted point represents the average of 50 diﬀerent runs of executions. The relevant curves are presented with 95 % conﬁdence interval. In particular, for the min-RM solution, we have considered a maximum threshold of 4 service replicas for each user application, whereas we have set 0.5 as the upper-bound threshold of reactive migration for the min-NSR approach. Fig. 2(a) shows that min-RM outperforms min-NSR by guaranteeing a lower probability of reactive migration regardless the number of users. Instead, Fig. 2(b) illustrates that min-NSR allows for achieving a reduced cost of service replica deployment compared to the min-RM approach. The results obtained from the conducted simulations demonstrate the eﬃciency of each proposed solution in achieving its key design goals. Furthermore, we remind here that a higher probability of reactive migration implies a greater necessity to perform a relocation of service instance,

as a response of user movement. During this migration, the user can experience longer application response times, thus suﬀering from QoE degradation. Also, it is worth underlining that the probability of user reactive migration increases for min-RM solution by considering a higher number of users. This is due to the restricted capabilities of ENs, which limit the maximum number of deployed replicas instances per user.
In the second analysis, we evaluated the impact of diﬀerent service replicas thresholds for the min-RM solution, by varying the number of users. In particular, we set the maximum number of service replicas to 2, 3, and 4. As shown in Fig. 3, the average probabilities of reactive migration take small values by increasing the relevant service replicas thresholds, since users can leverage more service replicas deployed in the nearby ENs. However, when the number of users with a higher threshold of service replicas increases, the edge systems is not

able to allocate all the requested service replicas, due to the limited resources of ENs, and the relevant average number of deployed replicas decreases, as shown in Fig. 3(b). As a consequence, for replicas thresholds equal to 3 and 4, the resulting average probability of reactive migration increases when a higher number of users is considered.
VII. Conclusions and Open Research Areas
One key vision of the upcoming 5G network deals with the the support of ultra-short latency applications, by introducing service provisioning at the edge of the network. To guarantee the strict latency requirements, new solutions are required to cope with the user mobility in a distributed edge cloud environment. The use of proactive replication mechanism seems promising to avoid QoE degradation during service migration between diﬀerent edge nodes. However, accounting for the limited resources of edge micro data-centers, appropriate

optimization solutions must be developed to reduce the cost of service deployment, while guaranteeing the desired QoE.
In this paper, we have proposed two linear optimization solutions for replication-based service migration: the min-RM approach aims at minimizing the QoE degradation during user handover; min-NSR approach favors the reduction of service replication cost. Simulation results proved the eﬃciency of each solution in achieving its design goal and provides useful information for network and service orchestrators in nextgeneration 5G cloud-based networks.
Nonetheless, several research areas remain open and could be the subject of future studies, as highlighted in the following:
• Path-oriented proactive migration: The current optimization approaches are designed to be executed every time user moves to a diﬀerent edge node. The proposed optimization approaches are based on Integer Linear Programming, whose solving times are suitable accounting for the low number of variables and a small-scale edge network. However, the execution of the optimization algorithms can be time consuming and suﬀer from scalability issues, especially for large network. A possible alternative can rely on the deployment of service replicas by leveraging accurate user path prediction from a source edge node to an estimated destination, thus requiring a reduced computation eﬀorts for deciding the optimal service provisioning. Further studies may also be carried out to evaluate the sensitivity of the optimization approaches with respect to the accuracy of the user mobility prediction schemes.
• Fair objectives trade-oﬀ : As evaluated in this paper, probability of reactive migration and cost of service replication represent two conﬂicting objectives. To evaluate a fair trade-oﬀ between the analyzed goals, diﬀerent models based on Game Theory may be further investigated.
