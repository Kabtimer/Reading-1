Abstract-Vertical Handoff decision algorithms facilitate the terminal to be connected to the network which suffice the requirements of the application. It ushers the terminal to be connected to the most optimum network amongst those in the purview of the mobile terminal. The selection criterion involves multiple attributes. Although many ranking algorithms have been proposed, there is a need to lay a stress on the user requirements and the terminal power consumption. In this paper we propose a ranking algorithm keeping in view the user preferences and the application priorities. Having a close proximity with TOPSIS algorithm, the idea proposed overcomes the ranking abnormalities and scores high on efficiency.
4G technologies are at the verge of making its own way to usher the research community to provide optimum access of network with the availability of very high data rates and efficient way of transmission. Also the increase in access of technologies like WLAN, Bluetooth, 3GPP cellular networks etc would make heterogeneous IP infrastructure the future of communication. Evolution of value added services and easy network access at any point of time creates a responsibility on the part of network provider to see to that the terminal has the access to the most optimum network at any point of time. Service Level Agreements (SLA's) amongst the network providers have further created a demand for a selection mechanism amongst those available.
Traditional handoff decision algorithm (Horizontal hand off decision algorithms) where the terminal used to switch to that mobile base station having a high signal strength are unable to meet the requirements of the emerging technologies and the multimodal devices. These devices have created a new requirement where the user has access to multiple interfaces for each application and also can select and switch to any of the available based on the application requirements, the interface capacities and the constraints of the mobile terminal. Thus the terminal has the facility of using multiple interfaces simultaneously which exists at that particular moment. This new need has compelled the service provider to avert form the traditional algorithms and move to Vertical Handoff Decision
access to thTehmio_st optimum network in the region of overlay
networks. Thus the user need not bear the extra cost and so does the network provider the extra burden on his/her part.

Quality of Service (QOS) requirements factors play a crucial role in selection process. Since the decision is based on multiple criteria and the importance of each of these may vary
according to the requirement of the user, this has been reduced to the problem of multi attribute decision making (MADM)

waoithmthe presence of a weight matrlx. Several MADM
algorithms have been proposed namely TOPSIS, SAW, AHP, GRE but many of these suffer from ranking abnormalities. Hence a ranking algorithm which can remove these abnormalities and can score high on efficiency is required. In the next section we proceed to look at the related work. The
subsequent section defines the variables. Later we explain in
brief the algorithm; and in the last section we discuss about
the results obtained.

III. DECISIONM\AKING CRITERIA
The attributes used for the selection algorithm use the same criteria that have been used in [5] for TOPSIS procedure. However there was a need felt for considering another criteria for the selection process. The attributes used are below. Cost Per Byte: This the amount charged by the network operator to which the user is subscribed or the operator whose services are in use. (Includes the roaming arrangements). Total Bandwidth: It is the overall bandwidth available over the link accessed by the mobile terminal. It is measured in
terms ofbps (bits per second).
Available Bandwidth: This is the measure of per user bandwidth allotted by the network operator which is dynamic and can change as per the uti.,lizat.i,.on. of,^ t. he netw,ork,. It i.s measured in terms of bps (bits per second). Delay: The packet delay gives the measure in milliseconds of the average delay for the packet on the wireless link. Jitter: It is the delay variations (average) on the wireless link of the network. It is measured in milliseconds. Packet Loss: It is the measure of average packet loss between the mobile terminal and the network operator. It is measured for every 1 million packets sent. Signal Strength: It is the measure of signal strength available to the mobile terminal from the base station of the network. This was the basis of traditional handoff procedures. It is measured in terms of dB-micro volts per meter (dBptV/m) Utilization: It is the percentage of utilization of the wireless link of the network used.
Terminal Power Consumption is one of the vital criteria to be considered for access of the network. For a mobile terminal having a low battery power, the optimum network must not only satisfy the QOS factors but also should give due importance to the battery power available at that point of time. For a mobile with low batter power, the network with high signal strength, moderate quality and cost may prove to be more efficient than the network with best quality, low cost but low signal strength.
IV. TUE PROCESS

each application varies, it is essential to consider only those
networks for the second phase which have substantial data rates that can support the type of application. Also, as the battery power and the processor speed play an important role for the network to be selected they are compared with the signal available networks at that moment to eliminate those from consideration which are far less compatible with the terminal power consumption

The application profile contains the type of application, the requirements of the application and the battery power gives the current capacity of the terminal in terms of power usage and can be used to set the cut off limit for signal strengths (in fact we set the lower bound based on the battery power at the moment of the terminal and also under the assumption that maximum battery power will be used).

B. Second Phase. It consists mainly of two steps
(i) Obtain the weight matrix (ii) Apply the ranking algorithm. 1) Obtaining the weight matrix. The total seven variables (AB TB U C D L J) are classified under three categories speed, cost and quality which are easily understood by the user. The user then gives the input for the three variables for each application in terms of linguistic variables (each variable having a value assigned to it) (Table given below)

MIADM algorithm is said to be ideal if the removal of the
bottom ranked candidate does not alter the ranking. However, TOPSIS algorithm did not meet this requirement and so iterative TOPSIS was proposed in [5].
For each of the attributes namely Cost, Delay, Jitter, Loss and utilization the affect of removal of bottom ranked network will either increase or decrease the median. In either of the cases the difference (Median - Attribute value of weighted normalized matrix) would vary respectively. However as we subtract from a common term the order for the each of column will remain the same (in the delta matrix). The same would be the case in case of the attributes Total bandwidth and available bandwidth (where the delta matrix attribute being Attribute value of weighted normalized matrix- median). Now, as the

order of each of the column does not change the value in the
rank matrix will also not change since it is the summation of the row elements. Thus the ranking will remain the same. Hence, the algorithm is consistent.

VI. CONCLUSION

M\ADM algorithms are very well known and have been

applied in many research areas. Coming to the application of

tThOePseSIaSlgoisriotnhemsoffotrhenemtowsotrkprseefleercrteidono,niet

has been found that compared to others.

It is proved that TOPSIS can change when a candidate at the

bottom of the ranking is removed from the comparison, and the iterative approach gives a more consistent and accurate final result. Terminal Power Consumption and User preferences are not given due importance of the available procedures. The algorithm proposed overcomes the above abnormalities and scores high on efficiency by consuming less

memory and at an optimum processor speed.
