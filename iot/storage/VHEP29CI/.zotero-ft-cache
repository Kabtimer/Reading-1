5G-IoT landscape

 Population of massively connected devices, different from the current one
 The lion's share taken by sensors & actuators and by everyday augmented objects typical of the Internet of Things (IoT)
 Virtualized and programmable network functions and resources
 Delivery of new and increasingly sophisticated services to heterogeneous groups of (mobile) users

Issues related to the IoT “structure” in 5G

What it was supposed to be: “A worldwide network of
interconnected objects, uniquely addressable based on standard
communication protocols”

What it currently is:
“A bunch of platforms in which smart things are not uniquely addressable and interact with their servers only, possibly, using proprietary semantics and protocols”

Causes and effects

Causes
 Slow standardization process  IT companies could not wait for
the end of the “war of IoT protocols”
 Well established business models
 Simplicity granted by a centralized
database

Effects
 Difficult/impossible interactions between
platforms
 Lack of global resource directory &
discovery
 Heterogeneous data semantics
 Difficult to distinguish infrastructure from
service provider
 Traditional interaction models only

Issues related to data casting in 5G
 the user/device will increasingly act as a prosumer

proliferation of unicast, broadcast and multicast traffic flows originating from heterogeneous access segments (fed into the network by highly mobile devices)

Key players requirements

In environments characterized by highly dynamic & distributed communities
What users want is:
(i) generating content for groups of devices and delivering it in a highly flexible manner;
(ii) receiving only desired traffic from reliable devices, to face the risks of circulation of fake and harmful contents.
What network operators want is:

(i) Keep the network load under control to guarantee committed performance to users
(ii) Easily handle traffic congestion issues

http://www.social-iot.org

Are current network primitives ready?
 Multiple unicast links are not an option (too many devices in 5G-IoT)  Current multicast and broadcast network primitives are likely inadequate:
 Multicast: underutilized  Broadcast: a “nightmare” for network operators due to
associated risks of network overload  Geocast: too restrictive
As a consequence…
 Design a new network primitive for group communications to:
 manage plenty of H2H, H2M, and M2M data exchanges
 support group communications in a flexible, reliable, and quickly (re)configurable way

Enabling paradigms
Let’s start from two pillars of future 5G-IoT networks!
 the paradigm of “social networks of devices”
 social ties create a social network of devices inherited from their owners
 communication end-points identified in terms of social distance
 device trustworthiness level computed by exploiting the view of the social network.

 the virtualization of both network resources (Software-defined Networking, SDN) and physical devices (object virtualization techniques).

First result: global system interoperability

Breaking down inter-system walls
 Global interoperability among heterogeneous IoT platforms achieved through end-device digital counterparts connected via social ties.

1. Social IoT
…reasons for a change of perspective

The IoT vision can be fully achieved only if objects are able to cooperate in an open way.

• Current implementations enable the cooperation among objects only if belonging to the same closed group.
• Sort of gateways are needed to allow inter-group communication and cooperation.
• The number of embedded computing and communication devices surrounding each of us will soon become too large:
 Scalability problems will emerge  Efficient cooperation between smart
objects creating trusted, dynamic sociallike communities might contribute to solve the issue.

…a matter of mental models

• Mental models are internal images or representations of something which people use all the time to make sense.
• People in general have little clue about how networks actually work, but most of us try to guess anyway, consciously or not.
• If a technology is not completely clear we make a guess on how it works by using a (usually simplified) mental model.
• As an example, technologies such as Wi-Fi, 3G or Bluetooth are simply called «wireless technologies» by using the concept of wire to give an idea on it working behavior

…a matter of mental models

• The main issue with the Internet of Things will thus not be to understand what is IoT from the technological point of view but how it works (complex dynamics to exchange data , interact with the services offered by objects hidden everywhere, control of our private sphere, etc..)

• The old mental model related to cables is only sufficient to understand the technological side of the Internet of Things.

• But, to avoid confusions (and refusal) and to make interacting users feel comfortable with the novel IoT paradigm it is interesting to resort to a mental model that man has developed for thousands of years: social behavior and social relations that are the basis of other ecosystems, and other types of networks (not technological but human ... for example)

…a matter of mental models

• Concepts of “friendship” and ”social relationship” are very intuitive!

• Ericsson researchers think that a solution to both the practical scalability issues and the mental model/pedagogical issue could be to simply “dress” a network of things as if it was a social network!

• It is enough to envisage a social networks of objects with relevant services that allows them to interact, express in a natural way which data they need, which service they offer to users, collaborate with each other to create collective services to offer to the user.

• Deriving concepts are «Social Web of Objects» * and «Social Internet of Things » * *

The need for social objects: an evolutionary approach
• Modern technologies have made “smart objects” available. • We are now witnessing to a generational leap from objects with
“smartness” to objects with “social consciousness”. • The evolutionary path towards the notion of objects that manifest a
social behavior began years ago (around 2000).

“res agens” (acting object)

“res sapiens” (smart object)

“res socialis” (social object)

“an everyday artifact augmented with computing and communication, enabling it to establish and exchange information about itself with other artifacts and/or computer applications.” *
“Smart objects might be able to not only to communicate with people and other smart objects, but also to discover where they are, which other objects are in the vicinity, and what has happened to them in the past.” **

What an “acting object” is?
• Recent researches addressed the issue of “smart” objects that exhibit pseudo-social behavior.
• An intense experimental activity involved everyday-life objects augmented in their capabilities to interact in modes which were inconceivable in the past
• The leap forward: distinction between a ‘thing’ that is simply connected to the Internet and a ‘thing’ with an active role in the network
… as a result:

• An “acting object” is an object that is able to translate the awareness of causal relationships - which are the basis of knowledge of change and evolution of its environment - into actions.
• a significant evolution in the concept of “spime” :
• the ability to foment action and participate;
• having an assertive voice within the social web.

Examples of “acting object”

• The Smart-Its Friends procedure allows users to set temporary relationships of friendship on Smart-Its* (smart wireless devices, with sensing, processing, and communication functions) based on the devices’ context.
• The so-called Blog-jects, a synonym for “objects that blog” ** , are examples of this new attitude to a “tight interaction with the world”.
• The theoretical concept of Embodied Microblogging (EM) *** , proposes augmented everyday objects to : (i) mediate human-tohuman communication and (ii) support additional ways for making noticeable and noticing activities in everyday life.
• Objects become able to develop a spontaneous networking infrastructure based on the information to be disseminated ****.

What a “social object” will be?

What we mean is an object that is part of and acts in a social community of objects and devices (which, in our case, is a Social Internet of Things).
Current open questions in the IoT arena: • what really an object has to say to another object for which you really need an Internet of Things • how these “conversations” between objects may promote the development of the human society
A social object for IoT adds further questions: •why objects should have their own social network, separated from that of humans, if they are not supposed to call each other to agree to go clubbing by themselves (at least for the next years)?

A director of science fiction movies has thousands of answers!

….but as pragmatic computer scientists and engineers we must focus on interesting use cases to implement!

Networks of social IoT objects

Two different approaches towards a network of Social IoT objects:

Social Web of Things (Social-WoT)
According to this vision there is an ecosystem that allows people and smart devices to interact within a social framework (Crespi) Web technologies are used in such systems to provide services *.

Social Internet of Things (S-IoT)
According to this vision Objects can also autonomously establish social relationships with each other and create social communities separated from those of human beings but subservient to their needs **.

Objectives of the social relationships established between social objects are twofold:
• Give the IoT a structure that can be shaped as required to guarantee network navigabilityc so as that service discovery can be performed effectively while guaranteeing scalability.
• Create a level of trustworthiness which could be used to leverage the level of interaction between things that are “friends”.

Defining a kind of social behavior among objects.
Which social relationships things can be engaged in?
Parental object relationship: defined among similar objects, built in the same period by the same manufacturer.

Co-location object relationship and co-work object relationship: determined whenever objects (e.g., sensors, actuators, RFID Tags, etc.) constantly reside in the same place (home/industrial automation services) or periodically cooperate to provide a common IoT application (emergency response, telemedicine, etc).

Anglet, June 25th 2019

Social object relationship: established when objects come into contact, sporadically or continuously, for reasons purely related to relations among their owners

Ownership object relationship: defined for objects owned by the same user (mobile phones, game consoles, etc.).

Status quo in Networking

 Control and Data planes are tightly coupled, embedded in the same device reducing flexibility and hindering evolution of the networking infrastructure
 Development and deployment of new networking features imply a modification of the control plane of all devices, installation of new firmware/HW upgrades
consequence

 Despite their widespread adoption, traditional IP networks are complex and hard to manage
 Network operators need to configure each individual device separately using low-level and often vendor-specific commands
 High capital and operational costs (CAPEX, OPEX )  Myriad of specialized components and middleboxes (e.g., firewall,
intrusion detection)

SDN pillars
SDN can be defined as a network architecture build upon 4 pillars:  The control and data planes are decoupled.  Forwarding decisions are flow-based, instead of destinationbased.  Control logic is moved to the SDN controller (NOS)  The network is programmable through software applications

Anglet, June 25th 2019

http://www.social-iot.org

SDN pillars

 The control and data planes are decoupled. Control functionality is removed from network devices that become simple forwarding elements.

 Forwarding decisions are flow-based, instead of destinationbased. A flow is broadly defined by a set of packet field values acting as a match (filter) criterion. It is a sequence of packets between a source and a destination.

 Control logic is moved to an external entity, the so-called SDN controller or Network Operating System (NOS), i.e. a software platform that runs on commodity servers and provides resources and abstractions to facilitate the programming of forwarding devices based on a logically centralized, abstract network view.

 The network is programmable through software applications running on top of the NOS that interacts with the underlying data plane devices.

 Co-location object relationships (CGLOR)  Co-working object relationships (CWOR)  Parental object relationships (POR)  Co-ownerships object relationships (OOR)

Others can be defined and the logic is represented in the SVE itself

 Sociocast: a new network primitive

Anglet, June 25th 2019

http://www.social-iot.org

Previous approaches

Social ties among devices already used to improve traditional communications paradigms at a middleware, application or cross- layer.
 forward data by limiting the number of relays until destination in multi-hop wireless (opportunistic and delay-tolerant) networks.
 identify the best data carriers through predictions based on social interactions (SocialCast, a routing framework for publish-subscribe).
 implement a social anycast communication service in DTN.
 implement video content sharing in Social-aware video multiCast (SoCast) systems to stimulate cooperation among mobile clients.

Idea: to leverage the “social network of devices” paradigm at the network layer

Why we need a “socio”-cast primitive?

The need for a tool to support traditional IP multicast.
 a primitive used by network operators to filter the set of nodes that can join a certain multicast group, based on their position in the social graph of devices.
The need for a dynamic & selective firewall.
 The filtering of the entities that can send it data can leverage:
 trustworthiness control policies offered by a social network of devices (like in human social networks)
 the reciprocal position in the social network
The need for higher flexibility in data casting.
 Introduce a network primitive that can make use of data structures, defined in the control plane at the network layer, containing basic metadata for device description.

The Sociocast nodes
Sociocast nodes exploit the new network primitive to deliver packets to a set of destinations on the basis of their mutual position in the Sociocast social graph.

The Social Virtual Entity (SVE) , with its “Friends Table”, stored in the SVER is the digital counterpart of each IoT node

Sociocast control plane

The Sociocast Edge routers
Edge routers are a key component that must intercept incoming packets with certain characteristics, interpret them, interact with the Sociocast control plane, and execute corresponding commands

 Sociocast allows to select:
 The destinations of a packet based on the position of their SVEs in the social network
Sample case: eHealth monitoring systems

Sociocast support in current networks

Sociocast control plane

IP Network  Sociocast exploits IP multicast to increase
network efficiency  assigns an IP multicast address to the communication & notifies it to R1, R2, R3.  The above edge routers will join the multicast group and the packet will be transported in the network along the multicast tree.

OpenFlow Network  Sociocast as a network application running on top of a Controller.
 R1, R2, and R3 are OpenFlow switches able to distinguish incoming
packAetstgeesnetrbateeddbyitsheuSoncidoceasrt pdrimeiptivleo. yment
 R1 sends packets to Controller, which forwards it to Control Plane  Control plane identifies destinations and provides the list to the
Controller that instructs the Flow Tables of Core Network switches.

Publish-subscribe Network  A major difference is that R2 and R3 are responsible to issue the subscription
messages for the packets transmitted by node A with a certain label.

Open research issues

 Relationship Manager:
 Need for solutions able to find relevant relationships in short time intervals (reasonable computing effort)
 Placement of SVEs:
 Performance improves if SVEs that establish relationships and interact with each other run in the same SVErver  Optimization
 Data plane:
 Need for a data plane enabling data transfer according to Sociocast primitive.  A non-disruptive transition from existing protocols is preferable.
 Sociocast programming:
 Need for suitable socket APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) with relevant socket options to enable hosts to join Sociocast groups

Anglet, June 25th 2019

76

 Energy cost:  Devices need to run additional operations  Energy consumption  Optimize the process
 Sustainability  Identify viable business models
 Performance analysis:  Need for proving Sociocast performance against changes in network topologies, user mobility profiles, social graph.
 Security & confidentiality:  to assure that exchange of information relevant to SVE is secure and controllable by the device’s owner
