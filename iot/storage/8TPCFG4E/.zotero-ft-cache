Abstract—Fog radio access networks (F-RANs) take full advantages of both fog and cloud computing technologies, and beneﬁt from using network slicing to support diverse services with different quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, to make the network slicing in F-RANs work efﬁciently, the radio resource allocation for different network slices is exploited in a downlink F-RAN with device-to-device communication, which is logically partitioned into a high-transmission-rate slice and a low-latency slice. A multi-objective optimization problem is presented with respect to diverse QoS demands, which can be formulated as a single-objective optimization problem with a linear weighted sum method. Then an equivalent drift-plus-penalty minimization problem with Lyapunov optimization is proposed, in which two subproblems are partitioned and solved by weighted minimum mean square error approach and Lagrange dual decomposition method, respectively. Numerical results conﬁrm that a [O(1/V ), O(V )] utility-delay tradeoff is obtained, in which either a 34.5% reduction in the queuing delay or a 6.5% increase in the average weighted utility can be achieved in a speciﬁc model by choosing proper values of V .
I. INTRODUCTION
As predicted by Cisco, monthly global mobile trafﬁc will be 49 exabytes by 2021 [1]. To meet the explosive growth, the ﬁfth generation (5G) wireless networks are presented, in which the usage scenarios are mainly classiﬁed into enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (uRLLC) and massive machine type communication. Among these scenarios, supporting high-transmission-rate communications for eMBB [2] and low-latency communications for uRLLC [3] has drown signiﬁcant attention.
To support various quality-of-service (QoS) requirements and eliminate redundant trafﬁc, edge computing and caching techniques [4] have been presented. In [5], a logic fog layer was introduced jointly taking the fog computing and caching abilities into consideration. In [6], a hierarchical content caching paradigm was proposed with ergodic rate and transmit latency taken into consideration, where the latency can be signiﬁcantly decreased. A framework that jointly considered networking, caching, and computing techniques was proposed in [7] to meet the requirements of next generation green wireless networks. Furthermore, fog radio access networks (FRANs) have been presented, which take full advantages of edge fog computing, centralized cloud computing and caching techniques [8].

Recently, network slicing is a proposed technology considering various QoS demands in F-RANs. On a shared infrastructure, network slicing is used to partition a physical network into several logical slices [9]. In [10], joint sub-carrier allocation and caching placement are investigated for two network slices in F-RANs with a two-step iterative algorithm. In [11], a distributed solution framework was investigated to maximize the proﬁt while guarantee users’ QoS by the joint slice and transmit power allocation. Moreover, to keep the network stable, Lyapunov optimization [12] was proposed to achieve the tradeoff between the queuing delay and the objective network performance with lower complexity.
Both high-transmission-rate slices and low-latency slices, which are referred to as eMBB and uRLLC in 5G, respectively, are concerned in F-RANs. With the consideration of delay performance, the optimization of joint power consumption, subcarrier and beamforming is studied. The contributions of this paper are as follows.
• The radio resource allocation is formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem, aiming to both maximize the transmission rate for eMBB and minimize the queuing delay for uRLLC in F-RANs.
• A single-objective function with a linear weighted sum method is ﬁrst presented. Then the Lyapunov optimization is used to reformulate an equivalent drift-plus-penalty minimization problem, which is partitioned into two irrelevant subproblems, tackled with weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) approach and Lagrange dual decomposition method, respectively.
• Numerical results demonstrate a [O(1/V ), O(V )] utilitydelay tradeoff. In a speciﬁc simulation model, choosing a proper V can bring a 34.5% reduction in the queuing delay or a 6.5% increase in the average weighted utility.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the concerned scenario is described. In Section III, the optimization model is formulated and transformed with the Lyapunov optimization, which is partitioned into two subproblems and solved with the WMMSE approach and the Lagrange dual decomposition method, respectively in Section IV. Numerical results are presented in Section V, followed by the conclusion in Section VI

II. SYSTEM MODEL
As shown in Fig. 1, the concerned F-RAN comprises an eMBB slice and a uRLLC slice. Suppose that the caching and computing scheme has been perfectly organized in fog access points (F-APs) and D2D transmitters (DTxs) to support user’s requirements by local processing and transmission. In the eMMB slice, cooperative remote radio heads (RRHs) connect to centralized baseband unit (BBU) pool through fronthaul links. The queue state information (QSI) at each user equipment (UE) is represented by the data queue. Suppose the total bandwidth W is orthogonally divided into ηW and (1 − η)W , η ∈ [0, 1] for eMBB and uRLLC slices, respectively. The time dimension is partitioned into slots indexed by t ∈ {0, 1, 2, ...} and the duration of each slot is τ .

QC (t), H (t) and F (t) are the vectors of QCc (t), Hlg (t) and

a bound on a drift-plus-penalty expression ∆ (Θ (t)) −

A. Beamforming Design
The weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization problem in (P2-1) can be reformulated as a WMMSE problem and a local optimum is achieved with the block coordinate descent method. The equivalence between the WSR maximization problem and the WMMSE problem is stated as follows.
Proposition 1: Problem (P2-1) has the same optimal solution as the following WMMSE minimization problem:

This optimization problem (24) can be settled through the

block coordinate descent method by iterating among wc(t), vc(t), and uc(t). For simplicity, the symbol t is omitted in the following iteration.

lem (P2-2) at slot t. Denote by IDmGax and IGmDax the maximum allowable interference on FUEs and DRxs, respectively. The
the transmission rates on FUEs and DRxs with IDmGax and IGmDax replacing the interference are represented by R˜lGg and R˜dDD , which satisfy R˜lGg ≤ RlGg and R˜dDD ≤ RdDD .
Then, problem (P2-2) can be approximatively rewritten as

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section, the tradeoff between the weighted utility and
the queue backlog for network slicing in F-RANs is evaluated. There are C = 10 CUEs and M = 3 RRHs in the eMBB slice, where Rreq = 1.5 Mbit/s and P R,max = 27 dBm. Each RRH equips with N = 2 antennas. There are G = 3 F-APs and D = 6 DTxs in the uRLLC slice, where 6 DRxs are paired up with DTxs, each F-AP g serves |Lg| = 2 FUEs, P G,max = 27 dBm and P D,max = 25 dBm. All devices are located on a circle with radius 100 meters, and occupy W = 20 Mega
Hertz (MHz) bandwidth resource. For convenience, the arrival
rate of each UE is supposed to be constant and represented as λ1, λ2 and λ3 for CUEs, FUEs and DRxs, respectively. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁx τ = 0.15 seconds and κ = 1.

A. Queue Stability Evaluation
The queue stability performance of CUEs is evaluated in this section. The value of the trafﬁc data arrival rate is set to λ1 ∈ {0.6, 0.63, 0.66} Mbit/slot at each time slot and η is set to 0.5. The average queue length versus t under different V and λ1 is shown in Fig. 2. It can be observed that the

average queue length becomes stable over a period of time and then ﬂuctuates around a certain value with t. Under the same V , a larger arrival rate leads to a larger average queue length, since different arrival rates cause different transmit power consumptions which are limited on each RRH. A larger V leads to a larger average queue length. This happens because a larger V makes us put more emphasis on the weighted utility, resulting in a larger stable value of the queue length. Moreover, it can be observed that under a speciﬁc arrival rate, i.e. λ1 = 0.66 Mbit/slot, choosing a proper V can bring a 34.5% reduction in the queuing delay.
B. The Utility-Delay Tradeoff
The average queue backlog versus V under different arrival rates λ1 ∈ {0.6, 0.63, 0.66} Mbit/slot is shown in Fig. 3, where the average queue backlog linearly increases with V for any arrival rate. It can be understood by the fact that greater emphasis is put on the weighted utility with increasing V , resulting in a larger queue length.

Fig. 4. The time average weighted utility versus the control parameter.

The average weighted utility versus V under different arrival rates is shown in Fig. 4. It can be observed that the average weighted utility increases with V for any arrival rate. This happens because greater emphasis is put on the weighted utility when V increases. Moreover, under speciﬁc arrival rates, i.e. (λ1, λ2, λ3) = (0.66, 0.2, 0.1) Mbit/slot, choosing a proper V brings a 6.5% increase in the average weighted utility. Both higher arrival rates of CUEs and lower arrival rates of UEs in the uRLLC slice will lead to a larger average weighted utility. It can be intuitively understood based on the deﬁnition of the average weighted utility, in which a larger arrival rate leads to a higher sum transmission rate in the eMBB slice and a larger sum queue backlog in the uRLLC slice. Fig. 4 combined with Fig. 3 illustrates the utility-delay tradeoff proposed in Remark 1.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, a delay-aware radio resource allocation for network slicing has been concerned in a fog radio access network. A multi-objective optimization problem has been formulated to both maximize the average sum rate for a high-transmissionrate slice and minimize the average total queuing delay for a low-latency slice. The multi-objective function has been transformed into a weighted utility function and reformulated as a drift-plus-penalty minimization problem with Lyapunov optimization. Then this problem has been partitioned into two subproblems, solved with the weighted minimum mean square error approach and the Lagrange dual decomposition method, respectively. A [O(1/V ), O(V )] utility-delay tradeoff has been achieved and the simulation results have shown that in a speciﬁc simulation model, choosing a proper V can bring either a 34.5% reduction in the queuing delay or a 6.5% increase in the average weighted utility.
