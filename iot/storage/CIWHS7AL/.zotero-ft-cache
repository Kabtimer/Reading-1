Abstract—In this paper, we study the resource allocation problem for a single-cell non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) relay network where an OFDM amplify-and-forward (AF) relay allocates the spectrum and power resources to the sourcedestination (SD) pairs. We aim to optimize the spectrum and power resource allocation to maximize the total sum-rate. This is a very complicated problem and the optimal approach requires an exhaustive search, leading to a NP hard problem. To solve this problem, we propose an efﬁcient many-to-many two sided SD pair-subchannel matching algorithm in which the SD pairs and sub-channels are considered as two sets of rational and selﬁsh players chasing their own interests. The algorithm converges to a pair-wise stable matching after a limited number of iterations with a low complexity compared with the optimal solution. Simulation results show that the sum-rate of the proposed algorithm approaches the performance of the optimal exhaustive search and signiﬁcantly outperforms the conventional orthogonal multiple access scheme, in terms of the total sum-rate and number of accessed SD pairs.
I. INTRODUCTION With rapidly increasing demands for mobile services, this requires ever higher spectral efﬁciency and massive connectivity in the wireless network [1]. Among several solutions for this challenging requirement, the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique has drawn signiﬁcant attention [2] around this ﬁeld and became a promising candidate of the ﬁfth generation mobile communication access. Different from the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), NOMA can accommodate multiple users in the same time, frequency, and code domains by differentiating the users through power-domain multiplexing. NOMA has the advantages of a low complexity receiver and high spectrum efﬁciency due to its multiplexing nature.
On the other side, co-channel interference is unfortunately introduced in the NOMA system since multiple users share the same spectrum resources. To handle this problem, various multi-user detection (MUD) techniques have been proposed, such as the successive interference cancellation (SIC) techniques [3], which can be applied at the end-user receivers to decode the received signals and reduce the inter-user interference effectively. Recently, different aspects of the NOMA scheme with SIC techniques have been discussed in several works. In [4], a novel NOMA transmitter and low complexity receiver was proposed and its performance was compared with the theoretical performance of SIC. In [5], the author studied resource allocation and user scheduling problem for a downlink nonorthogonal multiple access network where the base station allocates spectrum and power resources to a set of users with

a joint algorithm. Although there are several works studying the resource
allocation problem in the NOMA scheme, the majority of them focused on the multiple access system and few of them have considered the relay network. In [6], the capacity of a basic decode-and-forward (DF) relay network was studied, and a sub-optimal power allocation scheme for NOMA was given. In [7], the outage probability of an amplify-and-forward (AF) relay network was derived and a lower bound of the outage probability was provided. However, none of these works have considered the radio resource allocation problem in a multicarrier AF relay network in the NOMA scheme. The welldesigned resource allocation can further signiﬁcantly increase the spectrum efﬁciency. However, the resource allocation problem in such a network is very complicated and challenging. Because each user and the relay in this network can allocate its own resource to maximize its interest, in which there are sophisticated competition and conﬂicts among the users.
In this paper, we consider a NOMA wireless network in which an AF relay assigns the sub-channels to a set of source destination (SD) pairs and allocates different levels of power to them. A SD pair consists of a source node and a destination node, and the source node transmits through the relay to its paired destination node. Each SD pair can utilize multiple sub-channels and each sub-channel can be shared by multiple SD pairs. For the SD pairs sharing the same sub-channel, the SIC technique is adopted to remove the inter-user interference. Joint sub-channel and power allocation is then formulated as a non-convex optimization problem to maximize the total sumrate. However, the complexity of reaching the optimal solution of the problem is extremely high because of the externalities among the users and the dynamic relation between sub-channel allocation and power allocation in this network.
To tackle this problem, we separate the sub-channel and power allocation as two subproblems. In the sub-channel allocation problem, we consider the SD pairs and sub-channels as two sets of selﬁsh and rational players aiming at maximizing their own proﬁts. We then formulate the sub-channel allocation problem as a many-to-many two sided matching game with externalities in which interdependencies exist between the players’ preferences due to the co-channel interference. A novel matching algorithm extended from the Gale-Shapley algorithm [8] is proposed for the matching game formulation. After the sub-channel allocation, we use an iterative water ﬁlling algorithm to allocate the power and amplifying gains

of the network. The properties of our matching algorithm are then analyzed in terms of stability, convergence and complexity in the following. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed matching algorithm in NOMA scheme outperforms OFDMA scheme signiﬁcantly, and is close to the optimal exhaustive search in terms of the total sum-rate.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II we describe the system model of the NOMA relay networks. In Section III, we formulate the optimization resource allocation problem as a many-to-many two-sided matching problem, and propose a matching algorithm, followed by the corresponding analysis. Simulation results are presented in Section IV, and ﬁnally we conclude the paper in Section V.
II. SYSTEM MODEL We consider a single-cell one-way NOMA network as depicted in Fig.1, with one OFDM AF relay R and N SD pairs. Each SD pair consists of one source node and one destination node, where the source node communicates with the destination node assisted by relay R. Let S = {1, 2, · · · N } denote the set of source nodes and D = {1, 2, · · · N } denote the set of destination nodes. We assume that relay R has full knowledge of the channel side information (CSI). Based on the CSI of each channel, relay R assigns a subset of nonorthogonal sub-channels, denoted as K = {1, 2, · · · K}, to the SD pairs and allocates different levels of amplifying gain over the sub-channels. According to the NOMA protocol [9], one sub-channel can be allocated to multiple SD pairs, one SD pair has access to multiple sub-channels in the network, and each SD pair shares the same group of sub-channels. In order to reduce the response time, at most Xmax SD pairs can have access to each sub-channel. Communication between the source nodes and destination nodes consists of two phases, described speciﬁcally as follows.

Fig. 1. System model of the single-cell one-way NOMA network.

In the ﬁrst phase, the source nodes transmit signals to relay

R. We denote the mth source node as Sm and the kth sub-

channel as SCk. The transmitting power of Sm over SCk is

denoted as pk,m, satisfying

K k=1

pk,m

≤

PSN

for

each

Sm

∈

S, where PSN is the maximum transmit power of Sm. We

consider a block fading channel, for which the channel remains

constant within a certain time-slot, but varies independently

from one to another. The complex coefﬁcient of SCk between

Sm and relay R is denoted by hk,m = gk,m/ (dm)α, where

gk,m denotes the Rayleigh fading channel gain of SCk from Sm

to relay R, dm denotes the distance between relay R and Sm,

and α is the path loss coefﬁcient. Let xk,m be the transmitting

information symbol of unit energy from Sm over SCk. The

signal

that

rezlaky,mR=rehcke,imve√spfkr,ommxkS,mm

over SCk + nm,

is

given

by (1)

where nm ∼ N 0, σs2 is the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), and σs2 is the noise variance.
In the second phase, relay R ampliﬁes the signals received

from every source node and broadcasts the superposed signals

to the destination nodes consistently [7]. Let Gk denote the

amplifying gain of relay R over SCk and qk,m is the transmitted

power that relay R allocates to Dm over SCk, where Dm is

the mth destination node. The relation between qk,m and Gk

is given by

qk,m = G2k pk,m |hk,m|2 + σs2 .

(2)

We also assume that relay R has a maximum transmitted

power of QR, qk,m and QR satisfy the following inequation
k∈K m∈D qk,m ≤ QR. Correspondingly, we denote fk,m as the complex coefﬁcient of SCk between relay R and Dm, and fk,m = ck,m/ (bm)α, where ck,m denotes the Rayleigh

fading channel gain of SCk from relay R to Dm, and bm is

the distance between Dm and relay R. Let Uk be the set of

SD pairs that have access to SCk. The signal that Dm receives

from relay R over SCk is given by

yk,m = Gkfk,m

zk,i + wm,

(3)

i∈Uk

where wm ∼ N 0, σd2 is AWGN. Assuming that σd2 = σs2, when we substitute (1) into (3), it can be reformed as
yk,m = Gkfk,m i∈Uk hk,i√pk,ixk,i + ni + wm. (4)

After receiving the signals, the destination nodes perform

SIC to reduce the interference from the source nodes of other

SD pairs with a smaller channel gain over SCk [10]. For simplicity, we only consider the channel gain of the second

phase, i.e., fk,m, k ∈ K, m ∈ D. For example, for Si, Sj ∈ Uk, if |fk,i|2 > |fk,j|2, Di can cancellate the signal-to-signal interference of Sj from Si while decoding. The order for decoding is based on the increasing channel gains described

above, which guarantees that the upper bound on the capacity

region can be reached [11]. The interference that Dm receives

over SCk is shown as below,

Ik,m =

|fk,i|2>|fk,m|2 G2k|fk,i|2pk,m|hk,i|2.

(5)

Note that the noise and interference for Dm over SCk consists

of three parts: the noise at Dm, the ampliﬁed noise forwarded

by relay R, and interference from other source nodes. There-

fore, the data rate of Dm over SCk is given by

Rk,m = log2

(6)

To better describe the resource allocation, we deﬁne a binary N ×K SD pair-subchannel pairing matrix Φ, in which φm,k =

3

1 denotes that Sm and Dm are paired with SCk. The objective

is to maximize the sum-rate of the network by jointly allocating

{φm,k, pm,k, qm,k} which can be formulated as:

(7g)

where (7b) shows that each sub-channel can be allocated to at most Xmax SD pairs, (7c) and (7d) are the power restrictions of the source nodes and relay R respectively. Constraints (7e) and (7f ) show that the transmitting power is no less than 0.

III. MANY TO MANY MATCHING FOR NOMA
As shown in (7a), the sum-rate of the network is determined by both power allocation and sub-channel allocation. Note that sub-channel allocation and power control of the transmitter users are performed by relay R and source nodes, respectively. Therefore, we decouple the resource allocation problem into two subproblems, sub-channel allocation and power allocation, to reach a sub-optimal solution. We ﬁrst assume that each source node allocates its power equally over the sub-channels, and the amplifying gains of relay R over each sub-channel are the same. Thus, the sub-channel allocation can be formulated as a many-to-many two-sided matching problem, which can be solved by utilizing the matching theory. Afterwards, each source node allocates its own transmitting power over each sub-channel with water ﬁlling algorithm [12], and relay R determines its amplifying gain over each sub-channel, as will be discussed in Section III.C.
A. Two Sided Many-to-Many Matching Problem Formulation
Sub-channel allocation can be considered by relay R as a matching process in which the set of sub-channels and the set of SD pairs aim at matching with each other. To better describe the matching process between the SD pairs and the sub-channels 1, we consider the set of SD pairs and the set of sub-channels as two disjoint sets of selﬁsh and rational players aiming to maximize their own interests. Since the source and destination nodes are already paired, we can transform the matching problem between the set of SD pairs and the set of sub-channels into another one between source nodes S and sub-channels K for convenience. We denote (Sm, SCk) as a matching pair if SCk is assigned to Sm. To describe the

1The outcome of the matching is the solution for relay R to allocate the sub-channels as the interests of the sub-channels and relay R are identical.

competition behavior and decision process of each player, we

assume that each player has preferences over the subsets of the

opposite set. The preference of the source node is based on its

achievable data rates, while the preference of the sub-channel

is determined by the total sum-rate of the subset of SD pairs

over it. Given V and V as two subsets of source node S,

SCk’s preference over different subsets of source nodes can

be written as

V SCk V , V ⊆ S, V ⊆ S ⇔

Rk,l >

Rk,l ,

(8)

l∈V

l ∈V

which implies that SCk prefers V to V because the former subset of source nodes provides higher data rate than the latter one. Given U and U as two subsets of sub-channel K, the

preference of Sm over these subsets of sub-channels can be represented as

U Sm U , U ⊆ K,U ⊆ K ⇔

t∈U

G20p0 |ft,m|2 |ht,m|2 σd2 + G20 |ft,m|2 σs2 + It,m

>
t ∈U

σd2

G20p0 + G20

|ft |ft

,m|2 ,m|2

|ht σs2

,m|2 + It

,m

,

(9)

which implies that Sm prefers V to V because of the higher channel gain. G0 and p0 are ﬁxed amplifying gain and source node power in the sub-channel matching process.

We then denote the set of preference lists

of the source nodes and sub-channels as P =

{P (S1) , · · · , P (SN ) , P (SC1) , · · · , P (SCK )},

where

P (Sm) and P (SCk) are the preference lists of Sm and SCk.

We assume that the preferences of the source nodes and sub-

channels are transitive and substitutable . Transitive means that

for all L SM L and L SM L , we have L SM L . Given a player i in K ∪ S, let T be the set of i’s potential partners

and L ⊆ T . Player i’s preferences are called substitutable if

for any players l, l ∈ L, then l ∈ L\ {l }. With the notion

of the preference list, we can then formulate the optimization

problem as a many-to-many two-sided matching game [13].

Deﬁnition 1: Given two disjoint sets, S = {1, 2, · · · , S} of

the source nodes, and K = {1, 2, · · · , K} of the sub-channels,

a many-to-many matching Ψ is a mapping from the set S ∪ K

into the set of all subsets of S ∪ K such that for every Sm ∈ S, and SCk ∈ K:

1) Ψ (Sm) ⊆ K, 2) Ψ (SCk) ⊆ S, 3) Ψ |(SCk)| ≤ Xmax, 4) SCk ∈ Ψ (Sm) ⇔ Sm ∈ Ψ (SCk)

Conditions 1) and 2) state that each source node is matched

with a subset of sub-channels, and each sub-channel can be

allocated to a subset of source nodes. Condition 3) implies

that each sub-channel can be allocated to no more than Xmax SD pairs.

The matching model above is more complicated than the

conventional two-sided matching models. In our model any

member of either set can be matched with any subsets of

the opposite set rather than a single member, because of

the interdependencies between the source nodes sharing the

4

same sub-channel. Therefore, the number of potential matching each sub-channel SCk decides whether to accept or not based

combinations can be extremely huge with the increment of the on its preference SCk . The matching process stops when no members in each set. This makes the problem quite intractable source node is willing to make new offers.

even when the power allocation is not considered. Therefore, to solve this matching problem, we develop an extended version

TABLE I SD PAIR-SUBCHANNEL MATCHING ALGORITHM (SD-SCMA)

of the Gale-Shapley algorithm [8] and propose a new matching

algorithm in Section III.B.

1) Initialization Phase

B. SD pairs-SCs Matching Algorithm

In this subsection, we propose a low-complexity SD pairsubchannel matching algorithm (SD-SCMA). To decrease the complexity of the matching process, we simplify the preference list of the source nodes. Since different sub-channels have a linear superposition impact over the interest of each source node, the subsets of K can be replaced with the sub-channels in K in the preference lists of the source nodes. Given k and k as two different sub-channels, (9) can be simpliﬁed as

k Sm k , k ⊆ K,k ⊆ K ⇔

G20p0 |fk,m|2 |hk,m|2 σd2 + G20 |fk,m|2 σs2 + Ik,m

a) Each source node constructs its preference list P (Si) , i ∈ S. b) Each sub-channel constructs its preference list P (SCj ) , j ∈ K.
2) Matching Phase
while In the ﬁrst round or any source node proposes itself in previous round for i=1:N if P (Si) is not empty Propose itself to the most-preferred sub-channel in P(Si); Remove the sub-channel from P(Si); for i=1:K if SCk has received any proposal if It’s a blocking pair Accept the proposing source node; Regroup Ψ(SCk) to maximize SCk’s utility; else Refuse the proposing source node;
3) Matching Finished

However, the preference lists of the sub-channel are unreducible because there exists interdependencies between the source nodes who share the same sub-channel.
The key idea of SD-SCMA is that each source node ﬁgures out the best sub-channel which has not refused it yet, and proposes itself to this sub-channel. After all the source nodes have proposed themselves to their preferred sub-channels, each sub-channel has right to accept or reject these offers. When all the source nodes have made an decision once and all the proposed sub-channels have responded to the source nodes, we say one round of proposals is performed. Before describing the algorithm in detail, we ﬁrst introduce how the sub-channels choose from the offers of the proposing source nodes by introducing the concept of blocking pair.
Deﬁnition 2: Given a matching Ψ and a pair (Sm, SCk) with Sm ∈/ Ψ(SCk) and SCk ∈/ Ψ(Sm). (Sm, SCk) is a blocking pair if (1) L SCk Ψ(SCk), L ⊆ {Sm} ∪ Ψ(SCk), and Sm ∈ L, (2) SCk Sm SCl, and SCl ∈ Ψ(Sm).
With the deﬁnition above, we can describe the decision of each sub-channel as below. Since the aim of each sub-channel is to maximize its own interest, Si and SCj form a blocking pair if a subset of {Si}∪Ψ(SCj) can provide a higher sum-rate than Ψ(SCj) over SCj. Under this condition, SCj will accept the proposal from Si and regroup the set of its matched source nodes Ψ (SCj). The process of the proposed SD-SCMA is to ﬁnd and eliminate the potential blocking pairs round by round.
We now describe the whole process of SD-SCMA to solve the sub-channel allocation problem. The speciﬁc details of the proposed SD-SCMA are described in Table I, consisting of an initialization phase and a matching phase. In the initialization phase, each source node and sub-channel constructs its own preference list according to the CSI of the network. In the matching phase, each source node ﬁgures out whether there is any sub-channel in its preference list that can provide a higher data rate, and if any, propose itself to the sub-channel. Then

C. Water Filling Power Allocation

Power allocation can be implemented after the SD pair-

subchannel matching. We divide the power allocation into two

phases. In the ﬁrst phase, the transmitting power of source

nodes is allocated through the water ﬁlling algorithm, which

can be presented as

(12)

is the water ﬁlling level of Sm over SCk, and Wm is the set

of sub-channels allocated to Sm.

In the second phase, relay R allocates its amplifying gain

over different sub-channels. We assume that the maximum

power that relay R allocates to each sub-channel is identical,

i.e., QK = QR/K. To maximize the sum data rate, relay R

provides the maximum power level over every sub-channel, so

that the amplifying gain Gk can be given by

Gk =

D. Stability, Convergence and Complexity
With the deﬁnition of blocking pair and the substitutable
preference lists explained above, we then introduce the concep-
tion of pairwise-stability as below and prove that the proposed SD-SCMA converges to a pairwise stable matching.
Deﬁnition 3: A matching Ψ is deﬁned as pairwise stable if it is not blocked by any pair which does not exist in Ψ.
Lemma 1: If the proposed SD-SCMA converges to a matching Ψ∗, then Ψ∗ is a pairwise stable matching.
Proof: If Ψ∗ is not a pairwise stable matching, it means that there exists a pair (Sm, SCk), such that L SCk Ψ(SCk),

5

L ⊆ {Sm} ∪ Ψ(SCk), Sm ∈ L, and SCk Sm SCl, SCl ∈ Ψ(Sm). According to the the proposed SD-SCMA, Sm must have proposed itself to SCk before since it can provide a higher utility than SCl. We assume that SCk eliminate Sm in the tth round, that is, Ψt(SCk) SCk L, L ⊆ {Sm}∪Ψt(SCk), Sm ∈ L. While SCk only accepts the proposals that provide a larger beneﬁt, we have Ψ(SCk) SCk Ψt(SCk). Finally, we have L SCk Ψ(SCk), Ψt(SCk) SCk L, and Ψ(SCk) SCk Ψt(SCk), which is contradictory to the transitive property of the preference list. Hence, theorem 1 is proved.
Theorem 1: The the proposed SD-SCMA converges to a pairwise stable matching Ψ∗ after limited iterations.
Proof: As shown in Table I, in each iteration, every source node will propose itself to the most-preferred sub-channel that hasn’t reject it. No matter whether the source node is accepted or not, it will not propose itself to this sub-channel again, which means that as the matching goes on, potential choices for each source node keeps decreasing. So the number of iterations is no more than K, where K is the number of sub-channels, and the proposed SD-SCMA will converge within K iterations. According to Lemma 1, the proposed SD-SCMA converges to a pairwise stable matching.
Theorem 2: The complexity of the optimal exhaustive search is O(2KN ), while the complexity of the proposed SDSCMA is O(N K2).
Proof: For the optimal exhaustive search, relay R exhaustively searches the best subset of SD pairs over every sub-channel. Since every source node and sub-channel can be paired with each other, there exists K × N possible combinations and the complexity of the optimal exhaustive search is O(2KN ). For the proposed SD-SCMA, in initialization phase, every source node converges its own preference list. The initialization of each preference list is considered as a sorting problem with the complexity of O(K2), and the total complexity of the initialization phase is O(N K2). In the matching phase, the number of iterations is no more than K, and in each iteration, at most N source nodes make proposals, so the complexity is O(N K). The total complexity of the proposed SD-SCMA is O(N K2) + O(N K) = O(N K2).
The whole resource allocation for the NOMA relay network is shown in Table II.

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed SD-SCMA in NOMA scheme, and compare it with the OFDMA scheme and the optimal exhaustive search with MATLAB. In the OFDMA scheme, each sub-channel can only be allocated to one SD pair at one time, while one SD pair may have access to multiple sub-channels. For the exhaustive search, we assume that Xmax = ∞, and power allocation is performed over each sub-channel. However, exhaustive search is unrealistic since its complexity is extremely high. In the simulation, we set the peak power of each source node PSN as 46 dBm, and the maximum power of relay R, QR as 86 dBm so that the maximum power over each sub-channel QK is approximately around 46 dBm. The noise variance σ2 is -90 dBm , the path loss coefﬁcient α is set as 2, and all user nodes are uniformly distributed in an square area with the size of length 200 m, with relay R in the center of the square. We obtain the simulation results as shown below, and all curves are generated based on averaging over 10000 instances of the algorithms.

Fig. 2. Total Sum-rate vs. Number of SD Pairs in different schemes (K=10).

Fig.2 illustrates the relation between total sum-rate and the number of SD pairs with the number of sub-channel K=10. The performance of the proposed SD-SCMA in NOMA scheme is much better than the OFDMA scheme, and is close to the exhaustive search. The proposed SD-SCMA in NOMA scheme outperforms OFDMA scheme because it takes a more sufﬁcient utilization over the spectrum resource. The total sumrate increases as the number of SD pair grows, and the growth becomes slower as N turns larger because of the saturation of the channel capacity. But when the number of SD pairs is much larger than the number of sub-channels, the total sumrate continues to increase at a low speed due to the multiuser diversity gain.
Fig.3 depicts the number of SD pairs vs. the total sum-rate in the NOMA scheme with different Xmax, and the number of sub-channel K=10. By comparing the curves, we ﬁnd that the total sum-rate is higher with a larger Xmax, due to a more efﬁcient utilization of the sub-channels. When Xmax increases, the marginal increment of the total sum-rate becomes smaller. Because as the inter-signal interference is increasing, it is more

Fig. 4. Number of Accessed SD Pairs vs. Number of SD Pairs (K=10).

Fig.4 shows the number of accessed SD pairs vs. the number of SD pairs, with the number of sub-channels K=10. The number of accessed SD pairs in exhaustive search is around 2 to 3 regardless of the total number of SD pairs, because several SD pairs with the best channel conditions always occupy all the sub-channels, which is unfair to other SD pairs. The OFDMA scheme performs better than the exhaustive search because of the limitation on the assignment. However, the number of the accessed SD pairs still turns saturated since each sub-channel can be allocated to no more than one SD pair. The NOMA scheme outperforms OFDMA scheme and exhaustive search signiﬁcantly because of its non-orthogonal nature. When Xmax increase, the number of accessed SD pairs will increase since each sub-channel can be allocated to more SD pairs.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we studied the resource allocation problem in a NOMA wireless network with a one-way OFDM AF

relay by optimizing the sub-channel assignment and the power allocation. By formulating the problem as a many-to-many two-sided matching problem, we proposed a near optimal SD pair-subchannel matching algorithm in which the SD pairs and sub-channels can be matched and converge to a stable matching. NOMA scheme greatly outperforms OFDMA scheme in terms of both the total sum-rate and the number of accessed SD pair number. The proposed SD-SCMA can reach a total sum-rate close to the exhaustive search with a much lower complexity and more accessed SD pairs. The receiver complexity inﬂuences the total sum-rate and the number of accessed SD pairs on different directions, and the trade-off between the total sum-rate and number of accessed SD pair number can be adjusted by maximum number of SD pairs that each sub-channel can be allocated to (Xmax).
