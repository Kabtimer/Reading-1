The generic hardware platform

The Arduino Pro Mini
The Arduino Pro Mini is a compact form factor Arduino board based on the ATmega328P microcontroller Use the 3.3v and 8MHz version of the Arduino Pro Mini for lower power consumption

You can get the original board designed by Sparkfun or get one of the various clones available mainly from Chinese manufacturer. The last solution is very cost-effective as the Pro Mini board can be purchased for a bit more than 1€ a piece.

Depending on how many sensors you want to connect, the number of ground (GND) pins may be limited. You can extend a GND pin with a header pin where all pins are soldered together.

The LoRa radio module
There are various LoRa radio modules that are all based on the Semtech SX1272/1276 chips family

Fully tested LoRa

radio modules

HopeRF RFM92W/95W

Libelium LoRa

Modtronix inAir4/9/9B

Most of SPI-based LoRa radio modules are supported. The Modtronix inAir model can come with header pins ready to be connected with Dupont wires, simplifiying the procedure.

The RFM95W can be found assembled (Adafruit for instance) otherwise there are many breakout boards available. We have designed one that is freely available: https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw#pcbs

NiceRF LoRa1276

Connect the corresponding SPI pins of the radio

module to the SPI pins on the Pro Mini board. MOSI

(blue) is pin 11, MISO (green) is pin 12, CS (white) is

pin 10 and CLK (orange) is pin 13 (right picture).

Then connect also the VCC (red) and the GND (black)

of the radio module to the VCC and the GND of the

board (right picture). The VCC of the Pro Mini board

gets 3.3v from the on-board voltage regulator.

Connecting a sensor
Use a simple temperature sensor: LM35DZ
Connect sensor's VCC pin Pro Mini's digital pin 9 to power the sensor
Connect sensor's Analog OUT to Pro Mini's analog pin A0 to read value from sensor
Connect sensor's GND pin to one of Pro Mini's GND pin
RADIO

Uploading our temperature template code

Get the Arduino libraries and code templates
Get the entire ZIP archive of the LowCostLoRaGw github repository at https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw

Unzip the archive and copy the content of the Arduino folder in your Arduino IDE sketch folder If you already have a libraries folder in your sketch folder, copy the content of the new libraries folder in your libraries folder

Open the Arduino_LoRa_Simple_temp sketch and select the Arduino Pro Mini board in its 3.3V & 8MHz version

Some clone version, check the VCC pin

Connect the Arduino Pro Mini to an FTDI breakout USB cable (in 3.3v version). Check the VCC pin and make it to correspond to the VCC pin of the FTDI breakout
Connect the USB end to your computer and the USB port should be detected in the Arduino IDE. Select the serial port for your device. Then click on the « upload » button

Sending LoRa messages
Device default configuration
Default configuration uses BW=125kHz, CR=4/5, SF=12 i.e. LoRa mode 1
This configuration allows for the longest range
The default gateway radio configuration is similar

Achieving ultra low power consumption
Run on battery
You can use 4 AA batteries to provide 4x1.5v=6v. This will be injected into the RAW pin of the board, using the onboard voltage regulator to get 3.3v. Remove the power led to greatly reduce power consumption: in sleep mode, the board draws about 5uA and can run for more than 2 years on the basis of 1 measure/hour
Ultra low power
Remove the voltage regulator and directly inject 3.1v – 3.6v to the VCC pin of the board

-+

By removing the voltage regulator, you can use a single 3.6v Lithium-based battery or 2 regular AA batteries that provides about 3.1v
You can use the VCC pin on the programming header to power the board, as the other VCC pin is needed for the radio module

Using other platforms
There are many boards that integrate a LoRa radio, mostly the HopeRF RFM95W radio module. These boards are often based on the ATmega328P (similar to the Arduino Pro Mini) or the ATmega32U4 where compatibility with the Arduino IDE is provided. They provide easier LoRa integration but are generally much more expensive than a Pro Mini + RFM95 radio module combination. We tested many of them and verified that our template code is working fine, including the lowpower mode. Note that the Pro Mini with both power led and voltage regulator removed shows the lowest power consumption in sleep mode: 5uA.
