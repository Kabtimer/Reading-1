Cellular Networks
▪ Can UMTS support Car-to-X communication?
▪ Ex: UTRA FDD Release 99 (W-CDMA) ▪ Speed of vehicles not a limiting factor
▪ Field operational tests at 290 km/h show signal drops only after sudden braking ( handover prediction failures)
▪ Open questions
▪ Delay ▪ Capacity
▪ Channels in UMTS
▪ Shared channels
▪ E.g. Random Access Channel (RACH), uplink and Forward Access Channel (FACH), downlink
▪ Dedicated channels
▪ E.g. Dedicated Transport Channel (DCH), up-/downlink

Cellular Networks
▪ FACH
▪ Time slots managed by base station ▪ Delay on the order of 10 ms per 40 Byte and UE ▪ Capacity severely limited (in non-multicast networks) ▪ Need to know current cell of UE
▪ RACH
▪ Slotted ALOHA – random access by UEs
▪ Power ramping with Acquisition Indication

▪ Massive interference with other UEs

Cellular Networks
▪ So: can UMTS support Car-to-X communication?
▪ At low market penetration: yes ▪ Eventually:
▪ Need to invest in much smaller cells (e.g., along freeways) ▪ Need to implement multicast functionality (MBMS)
▪ Main use case for UMTS: centralized services
▪ Ex.: Google Maps Traffic ▪ Collect information from UMTS devices ▪ Storage of data on central server ▪ Dissemination via Internet ( ideal for cellular networks)

▪ Chose two primes: q, p with q != p ▪ Calculate n = p · q ▪ Calculate φ(n) = (p − 1) · (q − 1)
φ(x) gives number of (smaller) co-primes for x. Based on φ(a · b) = φ(a) · φ(b) · (d/φ(d)) with d = gcd(a, b) If x is prime, this is x − 1. ▪ Choose e co-prime to φ(n) with 1 < e < φ(n) ▪ Calculate d using EEA, so that e · d mod φ(n) = 1 ▪ Public Key: K+ = {e, n}, Private Key: K- = {d, n}. ▪ En/Decryption: Me mod n = C Cd mod n = M

IEEE 1609
▪ Certificates
▪ Encryption is useless without authentication
▪ Alice ⬄ Eve ⬄ Bob ▪ Eve can pretend to be Alice,
replace K+A with own key K+E
▪ Solution: use Trusted Third Party (TTP) and certificates
▪ TTP signs (Name, Key) tuple, vouches for validity and authorization: “Alice has Public Key K+A, may participate as OBU until 2019”
▪ not: “whoever sends this packet is Alice” ▪ not: “whoever sends this packet has Public Key K+A”
▪ Send K+A together with certificate vouching for tuple
