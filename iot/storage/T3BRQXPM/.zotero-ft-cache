Timer and Sensors
Timers of Contiki
Trigger events at a given time as blinking a LED every 5 seconds
- Simple Timer: The application can check manually if the timer has expired. You can see for more details: core/sys/timer.h
- Simple Timer: When a timer expires it can callback a given function core/sys/ctimer.h
- Event timer: Application trigger an event after timer expires. core/sys/etimer.h - Real Time Timer: It handles the scheduling and execution of real time tasks
core/sys/rtimer.h

Timer and Sensors
Example 1 : Timers
When timer expires, an application changes its behavior → Event Timer
CLOCK_SECOND is a value related to the number of the microcontroller’s ticks per second. CLOCK_SECOND also differs.
PROCESS_WAIT_EVENT() waits for any event to happen.

Timer and Sensors
Exercise 1:
1) Print the value of CLOCK_SECOND to count how many ticks you have in one second?
2) Blink a LED for a certain number of seconds. 3) Add an application related to your timer and button. The timer starts
only when the button is pressed and stops when the button is
pressed again.

Sensors
Electrical and optical signals are the output of a sensed variable. Contiki implements sensors as follow: SENSORS_SENSOR (sensor, SENSOR_NAME, value, configure, status); The method configure the sensor, poll the sensor status and request a value. The sensor structure contains pointers to these functions. The arguments for each function are shown below.

For analog sensors: platform/zoul/dev/adc-sensors.c

Timer and Sensors
Phidget Sensors
%Enable or configure the sensor SENSORS_ACTIVATE(sensor)
%Desable the sensor SENSORS_DEACTIVATE(sensor)
%Request a type of value to the sensor (tempertature, humidity, etc). sensor.value(type);
RE-Mote allows up to 6 analog sensors to be connected, but only two phidget connectors can be soldered at the same time.
It is possible to connect 3,3V and 5V analog sensor with ADC1 and ADC 3, respectively.

Parameter of a Phidget light sensor

One lux is equal to one lumen per square meter

1 lx = 1 lm/m2

Timer and Sensors

To read data from an attached sensor (as we did in the previous example)

ANALOG_GROVE_LIGHT In the case of light sensor

Choose which ADC channel to ADC driver header enable (here all channels)

Request a sensed value example/zolertia/zoul/zoul-demo.c gives more details.

Timer and Sensors
Exercise 2:
1) Make the sensor take readings as fast as possible.
2) Print to the screen the ADC raw values and the millivolts (as this sensor is linear, the voltage corresponds to the luxes). What are the max and min values you can get?
3) What is the average light value of the room?
4) Create an application that turns the red LED on when it is dark and the blue LED on when the room is bright. In between, all the LEDs should be off. Add a timer and measure the light every 10 seconds.
5) Send the reading of the sensor to a mote connected to the PC (Sink). You should choose 1) Unicast application 2) Broadcast application
