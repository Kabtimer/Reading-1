HOW TO HANDLE SUCH A LARGE NUMBER OF
DEVICES?
A large share of IoT devices will be served by short-range radio technologies
­ Unlicensed spectrum (e.g. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth)
­ Costless but … ­ Limited QoS and security requirements
A significant proportion will be enabled by wide area networks (WANs)
­ Unlicensed Low Power Wide Area (LPWA): LoRa, Sigfox, …
­ Very limited demands on throughput, reliability and QoS
­ Licensed spectrum: 4G, NB-IoT, 5G, …
­ Largely responsible for wireless connectivity on a global scale ­ Adapted to deliver reliable, secure and diverse IoT services

CELLULAR NETWORK ARCHITECTURE
CONGESTION LOCALIZATION

A huge number of devices ...
... but a limited number of resources (i.e., # of opportunities to connect)
Random access
­ Only way to access the network (simplest) ­ The most critical area
Complex traffic pattern
­ Poisson (e.g. credit machine in shops), Uniform (e.g. traffic lights), Beta (e.g. event driven)

ACCESS OVERVIEW OF IOT DEVICES Understanding the origin of the problem 8

ATTACH PROCEDURE

First PRACH opportunity

Attach procedure is needed before any connection

The main steps to move from idle to connected

­ Cell search and Synchronization procedures

­ Acquiring the cell system information

­ when and where the preamble can be transmitted

­ number of available RA preambles

­ maximum number of transmissions of the preamble when a failure takes place

­ size of Random Access Response (RAR) window (in number of subframes)

­ RACH Procedure (Random Access Channel)

­ Contention-based Random access

Limited radio resources opportunities (4-64 opportunity/Frame)

SOME EXISTING APPROACHES TO TACKLE THE
CONGESTION AT THE ACCESS
Access planning
­ Limit the burden … but insufficient since some devices react to events which cannot be timed.
Grouping devices Pull based scheme
­ A paging message may also include a back-off time for the MTC
Separate RACH resources for MTC
­ Splitting the preambles into H2H group(s) and MTC group(s) ­ or allocating PRACH occasions in time or frequency to either H2H or MTC devices.
Dynamic allocation of RACH resources Access Class Barring (ACB)
­ UE individual Access Class Barring ­ Extended Access Barring

20
access management of MTC devices ». In proc. of IEEE CCNC, Las Vegas, USA (January 2016)

DIFFICULTY TO KNOW IN ADVANCE HOW MUCH TERMINALS WILL CONTEND FOR THE ACCESS
Planning doesn’t really solve the problem
­We may know the time interval for the connection but not the exact time
The access of event-driven applications cannot be quantified and cannot be planned
21

WHAT ABOUT USING A MODEL AGNOSTIC APPROACH?

The Discrete Proportional Integral Controller (PID)
­ Reduced complexity
­ Exploits the difference between the measured value and the targeted value
­ Well know, common and robust controller
Does not really scale for a massive number of IoT devices
­ Adaptive version … ­ Improving the estimation of the number of IoT
devices

CONCLUSIONS
Estimating the number of IoT devices willing to connect and the IoT devices contending for the access is a requirement
­ Only way to guarantee the QoE ­ Same technique could be used to estimate the number of different classes of IoT devices willing to connect
Need to develop such techniques for other networks than mobile networks (i.e. LoRa, Sigfox, …)
