Packaging your IoT device: casing, sensors,
antennas,…

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

3

Get a case for outdoor usage

The case should be water-resistant (not necessarily water-proof). Some cases (like the black one on the right) already have cable gland but most of them are just simple case and you may need to add your own cable gland by drilling appropriate holes.

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

4

Connecting sensors
q When connecting sensor, you have to adapt the design so that your sensor is not going to be damaged by water, humidity, dust, sun, …
q In many cases, using a cable gland is enough
q In some cases, more complex design is needed to get the measure you need: e.g. soil humidity at larger depth

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

5

Protecting from rain & sun

If you case has holes or cable glands, avoid placing them upward to limit water infiltration! Always tighten all cable glands.

q Strongly tighten all cable glands, especially the one of the antenna cable (if any) so that the cable cannot turn and get disconnected from the radio module!

q Remember to put a shade cover to protect from direct

sun!

7

Connecting an antenna to the sensing device
q Many low-cost antenna that you can buy are usually simple ¼ wave whip/monopole antenna with connector (usually SMA-male)

FM
Make sure that you have matching connectors!
By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

The antenna can be connected directly to the radio module of the end-device. In this case, use a larger cable gland to connect the antenna through the cable gland.
8

Use a coaxial antenna cable

q However, when the antenna is connected directly to the radio module, placing the device may be difficult as the antenna should be placed at a high location such as on top of a mast.

q Using an extension coaxial cable

between the antenna and the

radio module greatly ease the

deployment of device but:

q The antenna cable should not be too

¼ wave monopole at the end of a coax

long to avoid high attenuation: 2m-5m

cable is not good!, Use a dipole or ground

q A ¼ wave monopole antenna WILL

plane.

NOT provide good performance

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

9

Antenna for device with a coaxial cable
q At the end of a coaxial cable, it is possible to connect a ground plane antenna (usually ¼ wave) or a ½ wave dipole antenna.

Ground plane Sleeve dipole

Simple dipole

More complex: collinear, array,…

q Some of them are easy to build (ground plane

and simple dipole) and there are many tutorials.

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

10

Simple ½ wave dipole antenna
q Very simple dipole can be made with 2 pieces of ¼ wave wires. ¼ wave in 868 is about 8.2cm (16.4cm for 433MHz ).

q There is no balun here but it is still better than the ¼ wave

monople if a coaxial cable is used.

q You can buy a 3m RG58 cable (SMA-m to SMA-f for

instance), keep the male side, cut the female side and

solder the core conductor and the braid as shown.

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

11

Simple ¼ wave ground plane antenna
q The ground plane antenna can be made with 5 pieces of ¼ wave wires.

N Female Panel Mount Chassis
q You can buy a 3m RG58 cable with an SMA-male at one end and a male N-connector at the other end. Or build your own cable.

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

12

Even simpler ¼ wave ground plane antenna
q With an existing SMA-m/SMA-f cable, you can also build a ground plane antenna by adding 4 radiant wires to the ¼ wave monopole.

q This is a cheaper solution for sensing devices.

Summary of antennas for sensing device

q The easiest solution would be to buy a general purpose antenna for the frequency range you are operating but these antennas have low performance
q If you want to try the DIY approach, try first the simple and easy-to-make dipole and see if the range is acceptable
q A ground plane antenna can be purchased or also made. You can test both solutions
q RF transmissions depend a lot on the antenna location, the environment and many other factors!
q More info can be found in our tutorial Low-
cost-LoRa-IoT-antennaCable.pdf
By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

General purpose but far from optimal: will certainly introduce high attenuation in RF signal
15

Before powering your device

q Don't forget that you should never transmit without an antenna!

q When a device has been flashed and each time you switch it on, it is going to transmit, so don't forget the antenna in any case!

q Put a name tag on the case to remember the device's address, see next slides

q It can be useful to have a switch to easily set the device ON/OFF. Take a water resistant switch, see the Low-cost-iothardware-parts.pdf

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

16

Device software configuration

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

17

Template configuration
Arduino_LoRa_Simple_temp
q For each sensor node that you will install you have to change the device's address, starting at 2 for instance. Address 1 is reserved for the gateway and 0 is for broadcast

q If needed, change the measure interval (and transmission), in minutes.

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

18

Setting PA_BOOST
q The Semtech SX1272/76 has actually 2 lines of RF power amplification (PA): a high efficiency PA up to 14dBm (RFO) and a high power PA up to 20dBm (PA_BOOST)
q Some radio modules only wire the PA_BOOST and not the RFO: RFM95 for instance has only PA_BOOST line

Uncomment the « #define PABOOST » statement, compile and upload again

Packaging your gateway: casing, antenna, power, internet connection,…

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

20

Get a case for your gateway
q Various cases can be used: from very simple ones for an indoor gateway to more robust cases for outdoor usage

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

21

Installing the gateway

q Power the gateway either with PoE or directly with a 5V USB adaptor.
q If possible, it is much better to put the gateway indoor.
q Try avoiding long antenna cable: 2m to 5m max.
q If the gateway needs to be put outdoor because of the antenna cable constraints, don't forget to protect it from direct sun!
q Get Internet access by connecting the Ethernet cable to a DSL or 4G router that will assign an IP address with DHCP.

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

22

Antennas for gateway
q Antennas for gateways can be placed on a building, at a high location.
q You can easily use ground plane or dipole antennas (e.g. sleeve dipole). More complex high gain antenna or a directional Yagi antenna can be purchased depending on your budget and whether the deployment allows it.

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

23

Internet connection
q See the gateway booklet

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

24

Gateway software installation & configuration

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

25

Gateway software installation

q An SD card image with a Raspberry Raspbian Jessie version is provided.

q You will need an 8GB SD card. Be careful, some SD cards will not work. This one has been successfully tested. It has to be class 10.

q Look at https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/inst allation/installing-images/ to see the procedure depending on your OS. 7948206080 bytes should be written, otherwise you may have a problem.

q Once flashed, insert the SD card and power-up the Raspberry-based gateway.

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

26

SSH to the gateway with WiFi

q The gateway is also configured as a WiFi access

point with address 192.168.200.1

q Select the WAZIUP_PI_GW_xxxxxxxxxx WiFi

q WiFi password is loragateway q Then ssh pi@192.168.200.1 q Login password is loragateway

You can use an iOS or Android smartphone or tablet to connect to the gateway with an SSH client app! See next slide.

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

27

Gateway access & configuration interfaces

q There are 2 interfaces
q A web admin interface q A command line interface that needs ssh
q Look at the gateway tutorial
q https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/mast er/Low-cost-LoRa-GW-step-by-step.pdf
q The web interface is sufficient for most users
q Easy basic configuration and easy update q Pre-defined cloud configuration q dedicated tutorial:

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

28

Gateway's simple command interface

q Once logged on the gateway, you may directly enter in a simple command interface
q This command interface consists in a cmd.sh shell script
q In image versions after May 2017, this script is launched when you log into the gateway with ssh
q If this happens, select Q and hit RETURN to quit this interface
q You should be in the lora_gateway folder

Configuring data management
q Received data from devices will be uploaded to the WAZIUP data platform.

q Modify clouds.json according to your need if necessary
q CloudWAZIUP.py script will use information from key_WAZIUP.py to configure data management for each organization

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

35

WAZIUP Cloud configuration

q Configuring WAZIUP cloud with web interface

WAZIUP cloud uses FIWARE platform with the possibility to define domains. The domain will be defined as project_name+''+organization_name+service_tree, e.g. waziup-UPPA-TESTS if: - project_name is waziup, - organization_name is UPPA, - service_tree is –TESTS service_tree can be empty otherwise it must begin with a '-'.
By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

The WAZIUP cloud tab is only available when key_WAZIUP.py is found
The device id will be organization_name+service_tr ee+"_Sensor"+device_addr. For instance, for sensor 2 hosted by UPPA: UPPATESTS_Sensor2.
Username and password of the WAZIUP account. If username is "guest" then all data will be public

Connecting your gateway to the Internet

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

40

1-DHCP solution

q The simplest way to connect your gateway to Internet is through a DHCP-enabled network

q If you use a DSL/3G router, the router will be the DHCP server

q If your company/organization has a local network, it is most likely that there is a DHCP server somewhere

q You can also connect your gateway to a computer/laptop which will share its Internet connection, thus acting as a DHCP server. That usually needs some simple configuration on the computer/laptop

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

41

2-Using a 3G dongle

q If you use a 3G dongle that you directly connect to the gateway to get Internet connectivity, be sure to use a DC adaptor that provides at least 2A

q Beware that not all dongle work. The Huawei E220-based dongles have been tested successfully

q You will then need to run a script to indicate that the dongle will be activated on boot:

q Log in with ssh on your gateway, quit the text command interface if needed (option Q)
q Go into 3GDongle folder: cd 3GDongle q Run ./enable-3GDongle-internet-on-boot.sh script q Reboot your gateway

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

42

3-Connect to an existing WiFi

q Configure the gateway as WiFi client to have

Internet connection through an existing WiFi

network

Configure the gateway as WiFi client to connect to an existing WiFi network. Changes will take effect after reboot.

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

Warning: if a valid WiFi network is not configured you will not be able to connect through the gateway's access point anymore. If that happens, use wired Ethernet to switch back to access point mode.
43

When everything is ready…

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

44

Last step before deployment
q Your gateway is now updated and configured q You can now reboot the gateway

q After reboot, check the WiFi SSID which now should meet your gateway's id
q In general, try to avoid unplugging power cable to shutdown your gateway. Use the web admin interface instead
q Your gateway is now ready to be deployed.

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

45

Gateway advanced configuration

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

46

Securing with Application Key (1)

q End-device can use application key (app key) on 4 bytes to allow filtering mechanisms at the gateway side.
q The app key is defined in the end-device sketch (Arduino_LoRa_Simple_temp) and the feature is activated by uncommenting #define WITH_APPKEY

#ifdef WITH_APPKEY /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// // CHANGE HERE THE APPKEY, BUT IF GW CHECKS FOR APPKEY, MUST BE // IN THE APPKEY LIST MAINTAINED BY GW. uint8_t my_appKey[4]={5, 6, 7, 8}; /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// #endif
q At the gateway side, post_processing_gw.py has a list of allowed app key

app_key_list = [

#change/add here your application keys

'\x01\x02\x03\x04',

'\x05\x06\x07\x08' ]

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

47

Securing with Application Key (2)
q With app key enforcement at gateway, all LoRa data to be uploaded on clouds will need a valid app key, otherwise the data will be discarded as shown below:
--- rxlora. dst=1 type=0x12 src=6 seq=136 len=17 SNR=9 RSSIpkt=-56 rcv ctrl pkt info (^p): 1, 18, 6,136,17,9,-56 splitted in: [1, 18, 6, 136, 17, 9, -56] (dst=1 type=0x12 src=6 seq=136 len=17 SNR=9 RSSI=-56) got first framing byte --> got app key sequence app key is: [9, 10, 11, 12] not in app key list invalid app key: discard data
q This is configured in the gateway_conf.json file. Set to true

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

48

How to use app key

q App key can be used to differenciate data from one organization to another
q Sensing devices of a given organization will use the same app key
q The gateway is configured to only accept this app key
q App key can be used to distribute the gateway task in case several gateways in the same organization are deployed
q Sensing devices will be caterorized with 2 app key q Each gateway will allow only one of these 2 app key q In this way, data that can be received by 2 gateways
will be processed by only 1 gateway

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

49

Securing by encryption (1)
q Arduino_LoRa_temp is an extended version of Arduino_LoRa_Simple_temp with data encryption feature.
q Data will be encrypted using 128-bit AES algorithm following the LoRaWAN encryption method.
q Uncomment #define WITH_AES

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

50

Securing by encryption (2)
q Encryption ensures confidentiality. The two 16byte encryption keys are defined in the enddevice sketch (Arduino_LoRa_temp)

q And should also be declared in the loraWAN.py script on the gateway
AppSKey = '2B7E151628AED2A6ABF7158809CF4F3C' NwkSKey = '2B7E151628AED2A6ABF7158809CF4F3C'

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

51

Securing by encryption (3)
q With encryption at device and decryption at gateway, there is more robust integrity check of the messages.
q Note that app key can still be used with AES, even if different gateways may have different encryption keys.
q To enable decryption at gateway, AES feature should be activated (set to true) in the gateway_conf.json file.

q Otherwise, the gateway will not be able to decrypt and therefore will not be able to push meaningfull data to clouds

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

52

Testing connectivity and performing range tests

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

53

Testing the connectivity between devices and gateway

q When deploying the gateway and the devices, the first step is to check connectivity and adjust the gateway/antenna location
q It is recommended to use an device programmed to send a message every 1 minute for instance (the Ping-Pong example with a small OLED LCD for instance)
q Place the device at the planned location in the field, with the mast, as for a definitive setting.

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

54

Remote access to your gateway

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

55

Remote access

q It is usefull to be able to remotely get access to your

deployed gateway for management and configuration

purposes

q There are many remote access possibilities and the current

distribution proposes 2 alternatives

q ngrok from https://ngrok.com

q weavedconnectd (remot3.it) from https://www.remot3.it

q ngrok is simpler but requires an interactive scenario

q You need somebody to log on the gateway locally to provide remote access information to the gateway

q weavedconnectd uses centralized web platform to provide remote access information

q If you have an account on the web platform, then you will be able to connect to your gateway remotely without interacting with a physical person

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

56

Using ngrok

q The ngrok binary is already included in the github distribution (/home/pi/lora_gateway/ngrok)

q You need to create an account on https://ngrok.com/signup. Then go to https://dashboard.ngrok.com to get your authentication token

q On the Raspberry, run the following commands
q > cd /home/pi/lora_gateway q > ./ngrok authtoken <your_auth_token>
q Replace <your_auth_token> by the token indicated in your ngrok dashboard

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

57

Running ngrok
q To start ssh remote access from anywhere in the world, even if your gateway is behind a local LAN, a physical person must run the following command on the gateway:
q > cd /home/pi/lora_gateway q > ./ngrok tcp 22
q ngrok will display something similar to

q Then, the local person should provide (using mail, SMS, …)

the forwarding info 0.tcp.ngrok.io:10403 for you to

use ssh

q > ssh –p 10403 pi@0.tcp.ngrok.io

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

58

Using weavedconnectd (remot3.it)

q The weavedconnectd and weavedinstaller binaries from remot3.it platform are already included in the SD card image
q You need to create an account on https://www.remot3.it/web/inde x.html. An account allows as many gateways as you want
q Then you have to register a gateway with weavedinstaller
q > sudo weavedinstaller
q Use option 1 to log with your account
q You will then need to give a name to your gateway
q For instance UPPA_TEST_GW_96

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

59

Create services

q You will then need to create a service (SSH or TCP for instance)
q Use weavedinstaller to install services that you want to use
q Here, the SSH service
q You have to name the service, e.g.
q UPPA_TEST_GW_96_SSH q SSH service allows ssh
remote login
q Install a TCP service to allow access to the gateway's web admin interface

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

60

The remot3.it dashboard
q If you log on your remot3.it account you should see your gateways and get access info to the installed services

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

61

Advanced power options for your gateway

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

62

Dealing with unstable power sources

q If your premise suffers from frequent power shortage or unstable power, you can invest in an office UPS (uninterruptible power source) system
q These systems are very common and are quite affordable. Designed to protect computers or other electronic devices, they can of course protect and power your Raspberry gateway as well
q Autonomy depends on internal battery capacity (which has price impact on the UPS system)

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

63

UPS hats for RPI

q There are UPS hats for Raspberry that can be a good alternative to office UPS if you only need to protect your gateway
q The PIJuice with its 1820mAh battery shipped with the hat can power your gateway for about 2 hours
q There are also cheaper, simpler UPS hats from China manufacturer (2500mAh battery included

About 50€
https://uk.pisupply.com/products/pijuicestandard

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

64

using higher capacity battery with UPS hats

q For the PIJuice, there is a 2300mAh battery to replace the default 1820mAh
q Both aforementioned hats can also charge any 3.7v single cell LiIon/LiPo battery
q You can therefore also connect most of smartphone LiIon batteries, small LiPo batteries designed for drone&quadcopter (middle) or highcapacity (>10000mAh) batteries.
q For the PIJuice, more info at https://github.com/PiSupply/PiJuice/ tree/master/Hardware

About 11h of autonomy with the single cell LiIon 10000mAh battery connected to the PIJuice

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

65

Autonomous gateway: Using a 12V car battery

q A 12V car battery is actually a very high capacity battery (from 60000mAh to 90000mAh)
q You can use simple 12V-5V car USB converter that are easily available to power your Raspberry gateway
q Take at least a 2A converter to avoid insufficient current issue
q You can expect about 5 days of autonomy when battery is fully charged

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

66

Autonomous gateway: mobility scenario

q You can use an external USB power bank that is easily available. Take a 10000 or even 20000mAh pack (left)

q You can additionaly use a dual USB cable to switch

battery without interrupting your gateway (middle). After

connecting the second battery, you need to switch it ON

before removing the first battery

q These battery packs can also be solar-charged to be

charged during the day (right)

Powering gateway with solar panels
q The UPS hats can also be used to power your gateway with a solar panel
q More info on solar panel https://www.solarfacts.com/
q Most portable solar panel (left) have USB output (5V) and can therefore be directly plugged into the hat's onboard micro USB (middle for PIJuice hat) which accepts voltage in the range of 4.2V-10V. See video link.

and-hardware-plus-6w-40w-solar-panels-video 68

Connecting larger solar panels
q To really achieve a fully uninterruptible power supply, a larger solar panel and a high capacity LiIon/LiPo battery (e.g. 10000mAh) should be used (more info: https://www.solartechnology.co.uk/support-centre/calculatingyour-solar-requirments)
q Large solar panels are usually 12V/24V systems (more info on solar panel specifications: https://www.altestore.com/blog/2016/04/how-do-i-readspecifications-of-my-solar-panel/)
q You probably need to regulate output from the solar panel to an acceptable range for your UPS hat, e.g. 4.2V-10V for the PIJuice, by using an MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) controller with DC-DC stepdown
q More info on MPPT: http://www.leonics.com/support/article2_14j/articles2_14j_en.php

Troubleshooting & FAQ

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

71

How can I know the sensor node is sending data?
q If you can connect the sensor node to a computer to use a serial tool (e.g. Arduino IDE serial monitor)
Otherwise, check that when powered on, the activity led goes through the following sequence:
- Fast blinking (booting) - Off for some seconds (working) - On for about 1s (transmitting) - Off (sleeping)

You can see the output from the sensor if it is connected to your computer. Use the Arduino IDE « serial monitor » to get such output, just to verify that the sensor is running fine, or to debug new code. Be sure to use 38400 baud. If you get the "Packet sent, state 0" result, it is most likely that your device is sending OK, but to be sure, you need to check data reception on the gateway.

How can I check that LoRa parameters are the same for
device and gateway?
q By default, all our examples use LoRa mode 1 (BW=125kHz, SF=12) with frequency of 865.2MHz (CH_10_868)
q By default, the gateway LoRa parameters are similar, -1 for frequency means default frequency
If you use different setting for your device, set the gateway's LoRa parameters accordingly

What is PA_BOOST and how do I know PA_BOOST is set correctly?

q The Semtech SX1272/76 has actually 2 lines of RF power amplification (PA): a high efficiency PA up to 14dBm (RFO) and a high power PA up to 20dBm (PA_BOOST)

q Some radio modules only wire the PA_BOOST and not the RFO: RFM95 for instance has only PA_BOOST line

q If you are not sure, then check packet reception at gateway and if the SNR is negative at short range then it is most likely that the PABOOST setting must be inverted at the device side

How can I activate local MongoDB storage?
q Log in with ssh on your gateway, edit clouds.json and check that the local MongoDB cloud is enabled: set to true if necessary

q If you changed the setting, reboot your gateway for changes to take effect

By Congduc Pham for WAZIUP project

80

What if the data web interface is not showing anything?

q When connected to the gateway's WiFi, opening http://192.168.200.1 will display the data web interface where data stored in the local MongoDB database are displayed

q If the graph section is displayed but your data is not displayed, check that local MongoDB is enabled
q If the graph section is not displayed, you need to repair the MongoDB database
q Log in with ssh on your gateway, quit the text command interface if needed (option Q)
q Go into scripts folder: cd scripts q Run ./mongo_repair.sh script q Reload the data web interface
