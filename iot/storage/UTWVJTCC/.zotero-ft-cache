SDR Features
Features of SDR
Recongurability and reprogrammable of radio Tx/Rx Baseband waveform or radio functionality stored in memory
Different modulations, error correction coding Functional blocks can potentially be changed in real time Operating parameters of functional blocks can be adjusted by designer or automated programs.

Baseband refers to the original data signal (without up-converting with high frequency carrier), whereas passband refers to filtered signal that was originally modulated onto a carrier.

SDR Features
Multifunctionality: Same digital communication system platform which support multiple types of radio functions. e.g. Download software design of a radio.
Global Mobility: Standards are defined for particular geographical area. With an SDR, the transceivers operations are transparent. e.g. ISM frequency bands are different from Europe and US.
Compactness and Power Efficiency: One SDR platform supports many communication standards.
Ease of manufacturing: Migrate a baseband functions from hardware to software
Ease of Upgrading: Latest updates of standard specifications are considered by updating firmware software.

Software Communication Architecture (SCA)

TE4R12 Codage - Software Defined Radio

17

Software Communication Architecture (SCA)
Definition Open architecture framework that tells communications systems designers how elements of hardware and software are to operate in harmony. [Hay03] It enables communication platforms (e.g. software defined radios) to load applications (e.g. waveforms), run these applications, and be networked into an integrated system. It was created for JTRS
