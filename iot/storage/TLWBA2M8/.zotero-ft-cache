Abstract—The performance of Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs), where LoRa networks are included, has spurred much interest in recent times due to the high interest in connecting more and more devices to the so-called Internet of Things (IoT). The massive number of connected devices associated to its random spatial deployment and random network access introduce new degrees of freedom, demanding for innovative performance evaluation approaches. In this paper we study the interference caused to a LoRa gateway due to the uplink transmissions of multiple coexisting LoRa devices. By admitting an uniform spatial distribution of the devices, we show that the aggregate interference caused to a LoRa gateway follows a nonGaussian distribution and its power can be approximated by a sum of independent non-identical gamma random variables. Our work adopts a typical LoRaWAN operating scenario where the transmissions of LoRa Class A devices are affected by path-loss, shadowing and Rayleigh fading. Numerical results obtained with the modeling methodology are compared with simulation results, and the validation of the proposed model is discussed for different transmission probabilities.

I. INTRODUCTION
The necessity of connecting billions of devices to the so-
called Internet of Things (IoT) has led to several standard-
ization initiatives and proprietary protocols. Despite of the
high number of radio access technologies already available to
support wideband data communications (e.g. WiFi, GPRS, 3G,
4G, etc.), it is widely agreed that radio access to IoT networks
requires speciﬁc protocols particularly tailored to support a
massive number of devices that may deployed as necessary.
IoT radio access requires the adoption of devices that operate
with very low power in order to minimize energy consumption,
the devices can operate in a very wide area, and in most of the
practical scenarios the transmission rate does not exceed a few
tens of kilobits per second. The response to these requirements
has been given by the so called Low Power Wide Area
Networks (LPWANs) [1], capable of offering affordable low-
power devices that operate over very large geographical areas.
Contrarily to short-range wireless protocols already proposed
for IoT radio access, e.g., Bluetooth, IEEE 802.15.4, LPWANs
support long range and low-power operation to a high num-
ber of connected devices at the expense of slowing down
the transmission rate and increasing latency. Several LPWA

technologies have already been proposed. Traditional cellular network operators are currently offering commercial LPWA technologies in licensed bands, e.g. LTE enhancements for Machine Type Communications (eMTC), Extended Coverage GSM (EC-GSM), and Narrow-Band IoT (NB-IoT). Simultaneously, proprietary LPWA technologies, e.g. Sigfox, LoRa, and Ingenu, have gaining interest due to the lower operational costs in non-licensed bands and because they can be deployed at certain areas where no cellular operators are available. In this work we are particularly focused on approaching LoRa due to the rising interest of practitioners, who are currently deploying a global open LoRaWAN network through personal gateways that enable LoRa devices to connect to a decentralized network to exchange data with the applications [2].
LoRa is a proprietary physical layer technology, developed by Semtech Corporation [3], that uses a chirp spread spectrum technique to spread a narrow band signal over a 125, 250 or 500 kHz bandwidth located in a sub-gigahertz unlicensed ISM band. This allows the receiver, usually a gateway, to decode signals a few dBs below the noise ﬂoor. The transmission range and the data rate can be also controlled through different Spreading Factors (SF), which vary the receivers’ sensivity threshold. LoRaWAN [4] is a medium access control (MAC) protocol designed to run on top of LoRa’s modulation. LoRaWAN offers bidirectional communications initiated by the receiver. The communication is initiated by a LoRa device, which sends an uplink message in a random access mode (similar to ALOHA). A LoRa gateway can then respond to the device if the uplink message is successfully received. The devices supporting the bidirectional communication scheme is designated Class A devices.
The performance of LoRa networks has attracted an increasing interest [5]–[8]. Real world indoor and outdoor evaluation campaigns were presented in [5] and [6], respectively. LoRa’s scalability was addressed in [7], by considering two capture conditions for the uplink messages. The ﬁrst condition considered the received Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), while the second one assumed that the uplink message is successfully received whenever its power is 4 times higher than any concurrent transmission. Based on the second capture condition [7] concludes that the interference caused by concurrent uplink transmissions can effectively limit the scalability of LoRa

networks. While [7] considers that LoRa devices adopt the same SF, [8] evaluates the throughput when concurrent upload messages are transmitted with different spreading factors. By considering that a few LoRa devices may use the same SF and the remaining ones can adopt different SFs, [8] derives the network’s throughput for different types of SF allocations. When LoRa devices adopt the same SF the capture condition must take into account the interference caused to the gateway by the multiple transmissions. Although LoRa’s performance is strongly inﬂuenced by the interference caused to the gateway, a detailed study of the interference in such networks is still missing. The transmission of multiple devices without adopting power control origins dominant interferers, i.e. the transmitters more close to the gateway. This fact explains the non-Gaussian distribution of the aggregate interference, making the interference modeling a more difﬁcult exercise.
Motivated by the importance of the interference caused by a massive number of competing LoRa devices, this work characterizes the aggregate interference caused to a LoRa gateway due to the uplink transmissions. We show that the interference power can be approximated by a sum of independent nonidentical Gamma random variables. Our work adopts a typical LoRaWAN operating scenario, where LoRa Class A devices transmit with a given probability and are affected by path-loss, shadowing and Rayleigh fading. Numerical and simulation results are compared to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed model. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the presented results are new and can deﬁnitely be used as a benchmark for future LoRa performance evaluation studies.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the LoRa scenario assumed in our work. Section III describes the steps involved to model the aggregate interference. Section IV compares and discusses numerical and simulation results. Finally, conclusions are presented in Section V.

II. LORA NETWORK SCENARIO
We consider a LoRa network scenario where the LoRa devices are spatially deployed in according to a Poisson point process (PPP) with spatial density λ. The devices are distributed over a circular region centered at the gateway, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Since LoRa devices transmit with equal power (no power control is used), the dominant interferers are the ones more close to the gateway due to the non-linearity of the path loss. This have motivated us to divide the circular region in multiple rings (annuli) with the purpose of modeling the interference caused by the devices located within each

R1 and RL+1 represent the inner and outer radius of the circular region. The area of each annulus l ∈ L is represented by Al = π (Rl+1)2 − (Rl)2 , where Rl+1 = (Rl + lρ) and Rl represent the radius of the larger and smaller circles of the annulus l, respectively.
The number of active LoRa devices located in the annulus l ∈ {1, ..., L} is denoted by the RV Xl. Since the devices are uniformly distributed over the circular region, the probability of ﬁnding k active devices located within the annulus l is given
by the truncated Poisson distribution as follows

where n is the total number of LoRa devices considered in the network. Each device transmits a message with probability τ . Regarding the assumptions related with the radio propagation, we consider that the fading between each device and the gateway is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d). Rayleigh fading and Log-normal shadowing is assumed.

III. INTERFERENCE CAUSED TO LORA GATEWAY
In this Section we study the interference caused to the gateway by the devices located within a generic annulus l (Subsection III-A). Then we characterize the aggregate interference caused by active LoRa devices located within L annuli and we address the PDF and CDF computation the aggregate interference power.

gateway from the active devices positioned at the annulus l is

which takes into account the instantaneous fading and shadowing gain of the channel, between the LoRa gateway and the transmitting device i, ψi, the transmitted power1 of the i-th device, PT x, the path-loss coefﬁcient, α, and the distance between the i-th device and the LoRa gateway, rl. Regarding the notation, rl and ψi represent the values of the random variables Rl and Ψi, respectively.
Small-scale fading (fast fading) and shadowing (slow fading) gain are represented by the RV Ψi. The fast fading gain is assumed to be distributed according to a Rayleigh distribution with PDF

The MGF of the interference caused by the i-th LoRa device

positioned over the annulus l, MIi(s), with i = 1, ..., nl, is represented as

MIi(s) = EIi [esIi ] = EΨi ERl [esIi ] .

Because the devices are uniformly spread over the circular

Assuming that the interference caused by a LoRa device, Ii, is independent of the other devices and are identically distributed, the MGF of the interference I caused by k devices is the product of the individual MGFs as follows

MI/k(s) = MI1(s) × MI2(s) × · · · · · · × MIk(s) = MIi(s) k .

Previous aggregate interference studies have already considered a circular region as the one considered in this work. It is known that the aggregate interference caused by multiple interferers (uniformly distributed over a circumference) to the node located in the center of the circumference can be approximated by a gamma distribution [14]. Motivated by the fact that the circular region where the LoRa devices are located can be decomposed into multiple annulus, similar to multiple circumferences, we use the method of moments to approximate the distribution of the interference caused by the devices within an annulus trough a gamma distribution. Finally, the parameters (shape (kl) and scale (θl)) of the gamma distribution, that approximate the interference power caused by the LoRa devices located at the annulus l are given by kl = E[I]2/Var[I], and θl = Var[I]/E[I].

B. Aggregate Interference

Departing from the assumption that the interference I caused by LoRa devices positioned over the l-th annulus is approximated by a gamma distribution with MGF MIl(s) = (1 − θls)−kl , the MGF of the aggregate interference caused by the LoRa devices located in the circular region (L annuli)
is given by

L
MIagg (s) = (1 − θls)−kl .
l=1

(17)

By considering the characteristic function of the aggregate interference power, represented as

L

ϕIagg (t) = (1 − θlit)−kl ,

the PDF of the aggregate interference is computed by

We highlight that the PDF of the aggregate interference in (19)

can be efﬁciently computed by using the Fast Fourier Trans-

form (FFT) algorithm, since the integral in (19) represents the

Fourier Transform of the characteristic function. Finally, the

CDF of the aggregate interference power can be computed as

follows

IV. MODEL ACCURACY

In this Section we compare numerical and simulation results of the aggregate interference power caused to the LoRa gateway. The LoRa network scenario considered in the comparison is the one represented in Fig. 1. LoRa devices are distributed over a circular region with a radius of approximately 12 kms, i.e., R1 = 20 m and RL+1 = 12020 m. The devices must be compliant with the duty cycle limit imposed by the regulatory bodies. Due to this fact we have considered a duty cycle of 1% (imposed in Europe for sub-bands 863.0 - 868.0 MHz, 868.0 - 868.6 MHz, and 869.7 - 870.0 MHz), i.e. each device uses the spectrum at most 1% of the time. In our model the duty

cycle is modeled by the access probability (τ ), meaning that on average nτ devices are causing interference to the gateway.
Simulation and numerical results are presented for two different densities of devices ({2 × 10−2, 2 × 10−1} devices/m2).
Regarding the radio propagation, the path loss coefﬁcient was parameterized to α = 4 [15], while shadowing and Rayleigh were deﬁned with σξ = 0.69 and σζ2 = 0.5, respectively. The parameters adopted to validate the distribution of the aggregate
interference caused to the LoRa gateway are shown in Table

To assess the accuracy of the proposed model, we have computed the PDF and CDF of the interference caused to the LoRa gateway through (19) and (20), respectively. The PDF and CDF are compared with the empirical PDF and CDF obtained with the simulated data. To this purpose, we have run 1 × 106 simulations that consisted on determining the power received at the gateway due to the multiple transmissions of the LoRa devices. For each simulation we have considered a different realization of the devices’ distribution, fading and shadowing power gain, and a selection of the transmitting devices according to the probability of transmission. In the model we considered L = 600 annuli of width ρ = 20 m.
The comparison of the CDF of the aggregate interference is illustrated in Fig. 2, assuming a spatial density of 2×10−2 devices/m2 and for two probabilities of transmission (τ = 5 × 10−3 and τ = 1 × 10−2). It can be observed that the aggregate interference increases with the probability of transmission, as expected. Moreover, the numerical results (represented in the ﬁgure by the legend “Model”) are close to the results obtained through simulation (represented in the ﬁgure by the legend “Simulation”). Similar results were obtained for different densities and transmission probabilities, indicating that the model is capable of presenting a good approximation of the empirical data. We have also validated the model considering a different number of annuli (L). For L ≥ 600 the accuracy of the model remains constant and similar to the one presented in Fig. 2, indicating that no signiﬁcant accuracy improvement is observed for L ≥ 600.
Finally, we present the PDFs of the aggregate interference for three probabilities of transmission. The results, obtained with the model for λ = 2 × 10−1 devices/m2, are presented in Fig. 3. As can be seen, non-gaussian distributions were obtained. Moreover, a different shape of the distribution is obtained for each probability of transmission, since the dominant interferers may impact differently on the aggregate interference.
