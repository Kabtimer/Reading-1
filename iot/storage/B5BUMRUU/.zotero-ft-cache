Title: A Novel Rate and Channel Control Scheme Based on Data Extraction Rate for LoRa Networks

(Submitted on 12 Feb 2019)

    Abstract: Long Range (LoRa) has become one of the most popular Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) technologies, which provides a desirable trade-off among communication range, battery life, and deployment cost. In LoRa networks, several transmission parameters can be allocated to ensure efficient and reliable communication. For example, the configuration of the spreading factor allows tuning the data rate and the transmission distance. However, how to dynamically adjust the setting that minimizes the collision probability while meeting the required communication performance is an open challenge. This paper proposes a novel Data Rate and Channel Control (DRCC) scheme for LoRa networks so as to improve wireless resource utilization and support a massive number of LoRa nodes. The scheme estimates channel conditions based on the short-term Data Extraction Rate (DER), and opportunistically adjusts the spreading factor to adapt the variation of channel conditions. Furthermore, the channel control is carried out to balance the link load of all available channels with the global information of the channel usage, which is able to lower the access collisions under dense deployments. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed DRCC performs well on improving the reliability and capacity compared with other spreading factor allocation schemes in dense deployment scenarios.
