Abstract—Up to recently, two main approaches were used for connecting the "things" in the growing Internet of Things (IoT) - one based on multi-hop mesh networks, using short-range technologies and unlicensed spectrum, and the other based on long-range cellular network technologies using corresponding licensed frequency bands. New type of connectivity used in LowPower Wide Area networks (LPWAN), challenges these approaches by using low-rate long-range transmission technologies in unlicensed sub-GHz frequency bands. In this paper, we do performance testing on one such star-topology network, based on Semtech’s LoRaTM technology, and deployed in the city of Rennes - LoRa FABIAN. In order to check the quality of service (QoS) that this network can provide, generally and in given conditions, we conducted a set of performance measurements. We performed our tests by generating and then observing the traﬃc between IoT nodes and LoRa IoT stations using our LoRa FABIAN protocol stack. With our experimental setup, we were able to generate traﬃc very similar to the one that can be used by real application such as sensor monitoring. This let us extract basic performance metrics, such as packet error rate (PER), but also metrics related speciﬁcally to the LoRa physical layer, such as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Signal to Noise ratio (SNR), within various conditions. Our ﬁndings provide insight about the performance of LoRa networks, but also about evaluation methods for these type of networks. We gathered measurement data that we make freely available together with the tools we used.
Keywords—IoT communication needs, LPWAN, LoRa performance, long-range radio, access networks.
I. Introduction
Tens of billions of machines and diﬀerent type of sensors are expected to be deployed and connected in the short term. A large part of these is expected to be covered by Wide Area Networks (WANs). In addition to cellular networks, the recently emerging Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are also a very suitable solution for this type of coverage.
These networks use a physical layer technology that trades bitrate for range, providing a wide coverage (up to tens of kilometers) and energy eﬃciency at cost of low datarate (in order of hundreds of bits or kbits per second, and, sometimes, much less). LoRa from Semtech

[1] is one prominent technology of this type. LoRa is a Layer 1 Network Protocol designed to work on sub-1GHz spectrum (109MHz, 433MHz, 866MHz, 915MHz). As those frequencies are globally available, without any licences, they are good candidates for the Internet of Things (IoT) communication needs.
LPWAN’s based on LoRa technology, are still insuﬃciently researched and tested. As far as we are aware, only a few publications are available on this topic.
Introduction and discussion of LoRa LPWAN technology is given by [2]. This work is followed by [3] where a description of an experimental deployment of a LoRa network is provided and a rough estimation of the number of gateways needed to cover a city is done. The performance of LoRa when transmitting through materials such as water and concrete is done in [4]. First short and longrange measurements was conducted by [5], however in a notably open/semi-rural environment. The measurement was done with few or no obstacles concealing the line of sight (LoS).
In this paper we build upon this work, extending it to diﬀerent areas, conditions, radio parameters and LoRa devices.
We ﬁrst describe the LoRa FABIAN network setup that was developed and installed by the authors, in cooperation with other colleagues, students and two companies - Kerlink [6] and TDF [7]. We give details about the overall architecture, equipment and protocols used. Then, after providing the current radio parameters used in our network, we detailed the measurements done and analyzed the performance observed.
II. LoRa FABIAN
LoRa FABIAN [8] is a Network Protocol Stack and experimental network setup, deployed in Rennes, France, for IoT needs. Although being mostly designed for LoRa and the associated constraints (most notably, low bandwidth) it can be reused on top of any Layer 1 technology.
LoRa FABIAN aims at democratizing access to lowpower long-range technologies, by abstracting the network complexity using common Internet protocols such as CoAP, DNS, HTTP(s) etc.
IoT objects are designed to run a local CoAP server and client which oﬀers resources and access to the object, which can be used to control the object and interact with its environment. This CoAP server is directly accessible

from the Internet, using an HTTP translator. That way, it can leverage all web technologies.
A. LoRa FABIAN Architecture
LoRa FABIAN uses diﬀerent components that are necessary to test and provide coverage for IoT applications. This include both communicating and gathering data from IoT objects, and connecting them to the Internet (both to send data, and receive remote commands). Therefore, the setup (as shown on Fig. 1) includes: IoT objects, LoRa IoT stations (that can communicate with the objects), and components that enable two-way communication with the Internet and its services (the Gateway and the Service node).
The experimental IoT objects are composed of an Arduino [9] and a FroggyFactory [10] LoRa Shield running a modiﬁed version of contiki OS [11], [12]. The LoRa Shield handles the low level communication and low level network access (registration, authorization, etc.), following a mechanism, that was designed by the authors and proposed in [13]. It forwards the data traﬃc to the Arduino, which allows the user to prototype application in a simple environment, by deﬁning CoAP [14], [15] based REST [16] resources, that can then be accessed from the Internet. In the same way, the user can use the Arduino interface to send data traﬃc to the network. The LoRa shield can have an embedded antenna or an external, soldered-on, antenna that provides additional gain.
The LoRa IoT station, built by Kerlink [6] is a LoRa antenna, that has the ability to connect with the outside via Ethernet or 3G. It can listen and send traﬃc (to/from IoT objects) using LoRa technology through multiple frequencies and code-rate at the same time. It redirects this traﬃc through a simple UDP tunnel to/from the LoRa FABIAN Gateway exporting data and meta-data in a simple JSON [17] text format.
The Gateway can communicate with many LoRa IoT stations in order to concentrate traﬃc for a global area like a city or a country. It is in charge of sending beacons to inform IoT objects about the network availability and to receive their registration messages, informing IoT objects they may have to change their radio parameters (frequency, code rate). All the traﬃc intended for the registered IoT object (downstream), and all the packets coming from the objects (upstream) then go through the Gateway. The downstream traﬃc can be stored here, to allow the IoT objects to be powered oﬀ and receive messages once they awake. Once registered, all the messages coming from the IoT objects are redirected using HTTPS tunnels to the Service node. The code for the gateway was written in Java by the authors and it is based on Californium [18], [19], as well as other libraries (JPA, H2 database,...)
The Service node, where every IoT object’s DNS name points to, runs a simple translator from HTTP to CoAP protocol (and vice versa) written in Java. The code was developed by the authors and is based on the Californium proxy. It receives traﬃc from the Internet and redirects it

to the right Gateway that the object is associated to, and vice versa.
Currently, the LoRa FABIAN network (as shown in Fig. 1) consists of three LoRa IoT stations (in diﬀerent locations), one Gateway, one Service node and number of IoT objects (used mostly for testing purposes).
B. Speciﬁcation and radio parameters of LoRa IoT stations and experimental IoT objects
LoRa IoT stations are running a customized Linux System on top of an ARM platform that uses a Semtech SX1276 chip for providing the LoRa connectivity with a 5dBm antenna.
Out of the three LoRa stations hosted by LoRa FABIAN, two are used for the production network. They are hosted by Télé Diﬀusion de France (TDF) [7] on two high points (one in 9 avenue Jean Janvier, 35000 Rennes, France, elevation: 85m, and the other in 2 Rue du Clos Courtel, 35510 Cesson-Sévigné, Rennes, France, elevation: 160m). The last LoRa station is situated on the roof of Télécom Bretagne (2 Rue de la Châtaigneraie, 35510 Cesson-Sévigné. Rennes. France., elevation: 55m) used as an experimental platform.
All those antennas are conﬁgured to use the following parameters:
• Bandwidth: 868.1 to 868.225Mhz • Channel size: 125kHz • Spreading Factor (SF):
◦ Sending (downlink), ﬁxed = 7 ◦ Receiving, variable, from 7 to 12
• Coding Rate: 4/7 (for sending, but can receive 4/5 to 4/8)
• Transmitting Power: 14dBm
The IoT object, for now, in order to receive traﬃc from LoRa stations, needs to use the same parameters, in terms of frequency, coding rate, channel size and SF. For transmitting they use a ﬁxed power of 14dBm. The FroggyFactory LoRa shield comes with an embedded antenna, however, in our setup, some shields were modiﬁed to have an external, soldered-on, antenna to test the performance gain.
C. LoRa FABIAN Protocol Stacks
LoRa FABIAN uses two diﬀerent kind of messages to communicate between nodes, over the LoRa technology. For interoperability reasons, we choose to use IEEE 802.15.4 [20] instead of using LoRaWan [21] as Layer-2 to transport our CoAP-based messages. As of now and for the sake of simplicity, the CoAP messages are send in clear text. Encrypting them using DTLS [22] and distributing the needed keys are part of our next steps.
a) Signaling messages: are exchanged between gateway and objects. Following [13], they are using CoAP to handle network announces (beacons), nodes registration, nodes control messages (e.g. radio parameter changes).

b) Data messages: are also exchanged between the object and the Service node. They oﬀer the user the ability the access the object directly through the use of CoAP to provide a REST semantic available via HTTP.
The protocol stacks implemented on each of the entities in the LoRa FABIAN architecture is shown on Figure 2.
III. Testing of the LoRa FABIAN network
These measurements are supposed to give us insight about the Quality of Service (QoS) that the LoRa FABIAN (using LoRA technology) network can provide, and give us statistical data for diﬀerent conﬁgurations of the network. Other than that, they can also bring to light some of the factors that need to be considered when testing these kinds of networks and provide some statistical data for diﬀerent conﬁgurations of the network.
For this, a number of measurements were performed in order to get basic metrics that can be used to describe

the QoS, such as the Packet Error Rate (PER), but also some parameters related to the Radio and LoRa layers, like the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), and the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI).
At the time of performing the tests, all the communication within the LoRa FABIAN network occurred on the 868.1KHz frequency band. The bandwidth that was used was 125kHz. These parameters, as well as the coding rate (that was set to 4/5), and the packet payload (25 bytes, including MAC frame) remained ﬁxed throughout the measurements. The parameters that were varied are: spreading factor (SF), distance, surroundings, antenna size on IoT object and elevation/location of LoRa IoT stations (by observing results on diﬀerently placed stations).
With this simple setup, we were able to generate traﬃc really similar to one that can be used by real application (like sensor monitoring), and then, from that, extract QoS metrics within various conditions. For this round of measurements we chose to focus on testing only the uplink (from IoT object to the LoRa IoT station), as this is the more common case in IoT.
First we did a basic test to get a rough idea about the range and performance of the three LoRa IoT stations (TDF Suburban, TDF CityCenter and TB on Figure 3), based on the station location but also on the distance, SF, and the type of antenna used on the IoT object. Following that, we gathered some statistical data of performance of LoRa for a certain distance (but with varying the location and surroundings). This data allowed us to evaluate the diﬀerent parameters (such as SNR and RSSI) in these scenarios, but also provided us with insight into various inﬂuences on the performance.
A. Range tests
To perform these measurements we moved on a trajectory (going up to roughly 3km away from TDF Suburban and TB stations, and 6km away from the TDF CityCenter

one, shown by pins on Fig. 4 and 5), with two IoT nodes that were periodically sending packets. One node (that we call Gamma) had a soldered-on antenna, while the other one (that we call Beta) had a weaker, on-board, antenna. For the ﬁrst round Gamma was using SF 12 while Beta was

using SF 10. In order to isolate the inﬂuence of the diﬀerent node antenna, the measurement was repeated, but with switching the SF’s (Gamma used SF 10 and Beta SF 12)
All three LoRa stations (positioned as shown in Figure 3) were listening, and logging the information (detailed in Appendix A, most importantly - RSSI and SNR) for each received packet. In this way we could compare the reception on each LoRa station. Since two stations (TB and TDF Suburban) were relatively close to each other, we could observe the inﬂuence of their placement (most notably, the elevationa).
The results from the three stations, when receiving from Gamma (conﬁgured with SF 12), can be seen in Figures 4, 5 and 6. Each pin represents one packet, as received on the given station. The pin color represents the RSSI of the packet. Red is used for packets received between -120 and -106 dBm’s, yellow for the range -105 to -94 dBm’s and green for the range -93 to -82 dBm’s and ﬁnally blue for the range between -81 to -69 dBm’s. (To access all the data, interactively on the map or to download it, go to [23]).
By comparing the results on the TB station (elevation 55m) and on the TDF Suburban station (elevation 160m), we can see that the elevation of the antenna makes a dramatic diﬀerence. At some areas along the road, there is complete blackout for the TB station (mainly in valleys), while TDF Suburban station’s reception remains active throughout the whole trajectory. During the entire measurement, in total, 1447 packets were sent. Out of that, TB station received only 748, while the TDF Suburban station received 1400. Maybe surprisingly, the station in the city center of Rennes (TDF CityCenter, elevation 85m) that is around 6 km away from the farthest point, received 1319 packets. We can also observe that the RSSI given by the TB station, throughout the whole route, rarely goes over -112 dBm, while on the TDF Suburban, more than half of the packets are received with RSSI between -92 and -81 dBm. It is interesting to note that the TDF CityCenter station is able to receive packets with RSSI below -124 dBm. Moreover, most of the packets (1088 out of 1319), on this station, are received in range between -124 and 103 dBm. This shows us that, in some cases, even thought

the average RSSI is worse, the reception can be better. Figure 7 shows the result on the TB station, for the
same SF, when using Beta (on-board antenna), rather than Gamma. In this case only 59 out of 1000 packets were received, showing that the use of a soldered-on antenna makes a signiﬁcant diﬀerence, with the success rate jumping from 6% to 62% when adding the antenna.
B. Fixed point measurements
In the ﬁxed point measurement we sought to take a closer look at the inﬂuence of location and environment on the performance of the LoRa network, so we chose 8 points (as shown on map in Fig.8) that were on the same distance (3km) from the LoRa station we chose to focus on - TDF Suburban.
Half of these points are located in a more urban part of Rennes, while the other half is on the borders or outside. The environment varied from suburb-like found in CessonSevigne, to ones mostly empty (with nothing but roadside restaurants), to a farm in a rural environment, and ﬁnally to points in the city of Rennes.
On each of these measuring points, 500 packets (each having a 25 byte payload) were sent out for SF 7,9 and 10. Gamma (with soldered-on antenna) was using SF 10 to send 500 packets, meanwhile Beta (with on-board antenna) was sending 500 packets for both SF7 and SF9.
This allowed us, to gather some statistical data about the performance of the LoRa network on distance of 3km in diﬀerent areas. The results are synthesized in Table I.
It was expected that in urban areas the results are going to be worse, and this was proven true by the packet error rate (PER) not going under 40% in this areas, however what is a bit surprising is the dramatic degradation of results in non-urban (even can be called rural) areas, such as the Joualt Hubert farm (C on Fig. 8) or Parc du Bois de la Justice (H on Fig. 8), with the PER worsening by 30% as compared to Golf de Cesson (A on Fig. 8). This

Fig. 10. Correlation between PER and RSSI, 3km from the LoRa IoT station
might be partly explained by the elevation proﬁle between the LoRa station and measurement point. Namely, when the elevation proﬁle between the measurement point and the LoRa station is strictly degrading - the reception is good. When some "hills" are present that might block the reception - it is much worse. In B you can ﬁnd elevation proﬁles between non-urban measurement points and the TDF Suburban station.
It can also be noted that the correlation between RSSI and PER is not straightforward. Namely, sometimes even when the RSSI mean is high the PER is going to be worse. This is more obvious by looking at a graph such as in Figure 10 showing the overall PER for each RSSI value at a certain location (the annotations on each point denote the number of packets received - both successfully and unsuccessfully - for a given RSSI) On the other hand, SNR (Fig. 9), since it takes into account also the current noise level, shows the expected property - more packets are lost when the SNR is lower.
Data availability
For the sake of reproducibility, and in order to allow everybody interested in this topic to reuse, extend and build on top of our research, we published all our acquired data, and all the scripts used for its parsing, plotting and analyzing. They can be found at [24] under a liberal opensource licence.
IV. Conclusion and Future work

designed, performed and analysed measurements for it. LoRa technology oﬀers a excellent outdoor coverage either in urban or rural area. As expected, the antenna location and especially its elevation plays a major role in the network performances. In the best conditions, the frames losses is very low (about 3%). One of the goal of our study was to deﬁne criteria to switch from one spreading factor to another one to guaranty the best trade-oﬀ between channel utilization and error rate. It appears that the RSSI alone may not be a good metric since measurement do not exhibit a strong correlation. SNR could be a better candidate. A next step will be to combine uplink and downlink traﬃc to ﬁnd if some correlation exists between measurements. This will be helpful to determine which LoRa station will be the best to join a node.
Appendix A
LoRa packet structure
Figure 11 shows the format of the packet in the LoRa network. The ﬁrst ﬁeld is the preamble, which is in charge of the synchronization of the receiver and the incoming packet. The next ﬁeld is the header which provides information such as the SF used, the FEC code rate and size of the payload. Then, the payload ﬁeld containing the data to be transmitted and ﬁnally the last ﬁeld is a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for error detection.
The structure may vary depending on whether explicit header is used, and also on the length of the preamble (currently, we are using 8 symbols)

A. Example of packet received by LoRa IoT station
Packets ﬂowing into the LoRa FABIAN network are received and sent by LoRa stations. In this section, we will present some example of LoRa FABIAN data, as they are received by one LoRa station. We will start by a simple raw example and then describe the LoRa layer meta data, and the 802.15.4 and CoAP data.

In this example, we are able to see the meta data in JSON format, as made available by the LoRa Station and the Semtech engine [25]. Description of each ﬁeld can be found on [25]
We can also see the payload of the LoRa data, including thus the IEEE 802.15.4 layer and the CoAP one. Table II shows the interpretation.
