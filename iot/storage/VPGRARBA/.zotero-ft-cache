ABSTRACT
Emerging 5G mobile networks are envisioned to support the dynamic deployment of services with diverse performance requirements, accommodating the needs of mobile network operators and verticals. Virtualizing the mobile network components in a exible and cost-e ective way is therefore of paramount importance. In this work, we highlight the capabilities of Orion, a novel RAN slicing architecture that enables the dynamic virtualization of base stations and exible customization of slices to meet their respective service needs. Our demonstration of Orion’s capabilities is based on a prototype implementation employing a modi ed version of the OpenAirInterface so ware LTE platform. Using this prototype, we demonstrate the functional and performance isolation, and the e cient sharing of radio hardware and spectrum that can be achieved among Orion RAN slices. Moreover, we show how Orion can be used in an end-to-end network slicing se ing and demonstrate the effects of the slices’ con guration and placement of virtual functions in the overall quality of the deployed services.

1 INTRODUCTION
e rapid increase in the usage of mobile devices in recent years has placed a big strain on the current mobile network architecture is paving the way for next generation (5G) mobile networks. Apart from the performance and e ciency improvements that 5G is expected to bring, another equally signi cant aspect of the 5G vision is the support of a service-oriented mobile network architecture [4]. is service-oriented approach envisions network support for a wide range of services, di ering signi cantly in their performance requirements and supported device types. A one-size ts all architecture is unlikely to be suitable for such diverse use cases.
erefore, it is of paramount importance to nd ways for increasing the exibility of the architecture, so that the underlying physical infrastructure may be turned into multiple logical networks or slices that are tailored in terms of resources (computing, network, storage, radio, access hardware and virtual network functions (VNFs)) to meet the requirements of the service in question [5]. In this context, network so warization via So ware De ned Networking (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), and virtualization are

seen as key enablers that can be used to create end-to-end network instances spanning both the core and the radio access network (RAN).
For mobile core slicing, research prototypes and operational systems using virtualization technologies and SDN/NFV principles have already started to appear. On the other hand, RAN slicing is at a more premature stage, with the main challenge being that apart from computing, storage and network resources, the limited radio resources need to also be virtualized and e ciently assigned to slices. is must be achieved while guaranteeing the functional and performance isolation between tenants and the infrastructure provider, and among tenants themselves, so that these tenants can maintain full control and independence of their slices to tailor them to the respective service requirements. State-of-the-art RAN slicing solutions solve this problem only partially, by focusing on some aspects of RAN slicing while sacri cing others. Speci cally, approaches with origins in RAN sharing focus mainly on the e cient sharing of radio resources with no support for functional isolation, giving the infrastructure provider full visibility and control over all slices (e.g. FlexRAN [1]). On the other end of the spectrum, the isolation is put at the center stage without considering the e cient and adaptive use of resources (e.g. FLARE [3]).
We a empt to balance these objectives through Orion [2], which in our knowledge is the rst RAN slicing system that provides full functional and performance isolation while also facilitating e cient sharing of radio and spectrum resources. e focus of this demo (elaborated in Section 3) is on showcasing the unique capabilities of Orion, as well as on demonstrating how Orion can t in the emerging 5G paradigm as a key component of an end-to-end mobile network slicing architecture. e next section gives an overview of Orion’s design and implementation.
2 ORION
2.1 Design
Orion’s design (Fig. 1) explicitly distinguishes the infrastructure provider from the service providers, who own the slices. e infrastructure provider is the owner of physical base stations, comprising of hardware resources (i.e., radio equipment, memory, CPU and network) and a chunk of spectrum. Regardless of its realization, either via dedicated specialized hardware or in a cloud environment using re-programmable hardware (e.g., C-RAN baseband processing unit and remote radio heads), each physical base station supports a single Radio Access Technology (RAT), meaning that all radio and spectrum resources available at the base station can be exploited through a shared physical layer.
e Base Station Hypervisor that sits over the physical layer is the heart of Orion’s design. It is the component used for managing RAN slices, enforcing resource segregation among slices (for performance isolation) and segregation in terms of control

logic segregation (for functional isolation) and for facilitating efcient sharing of underlying physical resources. Essentially, the
Hypervisor is the liaison that binds the individual (and mutually isolated) slices to the physical infrastructure, providing them with a virtual view of the underlying radio resources and data plane state, and maintaining a mapping between virtual and physical resources so that slice state changes may be applied over the physical data plane. e Hypervisor is part of the infrastructure provider’s so ware infrastructure to support RAN slicing. e infrastructure provider is also responsible for admission control.
Service providers (e.g., MVNOs and verticals) in Orion realize their RAN slices through the creation of virtual base stations over the Hypervisor. Each virtual base station is a composition of a virtual control plane, responsible for managing the data plane state revealed to it by the Hypervisor. Following SDN principles, Orion’s design assumes control-data plane separation, where the virtual control plane of a slice is e ectively a local RAN-level slice controller running as a separate process, responsible to tailor the functionality and manage the allocation of resources to the mobile devices associated with the slice as if the slice was operating using its own dedicated infrastructure. e virtual control plane is also responsible for implementing the control protocols required for the communication and coordination of the virtual base station with the rest of the mobile infrastructure (e.g., S1 and X2 interfaces in LTE). is means that all operations de ned for a given mobile network architecture can be supported by slices so long as the appropriate interfaces and messages are implemented as part of the respective virtual control planes.
2.2 Key Properties of Orion
e design of Orion provides strong isolation guarantees while allowing e cient resource sharing.
First, since each of the slice controllers runs as a separate process, isolation among controllers in terms of memory and CPU can

leverage well known OS and process virtualization techniques, like virtual machines (e.g., KVM) or containers (e.g., Docker). Second, the Hypervisor is the sole entity responsible for handling actual radio resources which it virtualizes and distributes among slices in an abstract form, ensuring isolation from a radio resource perspective. e isolation properties of Orion are illustrated in the example of Fig. 2 for 2 slices, where the throughput of the UEs in one slice remains una ected from the changes in the state of the other slice. More speci cally, the addition of more UEs in one slice at t1-3 only a ects the throughput of the UEs co-existing in the same slice, leaving the other slice una ected (indicating performance isolation). Similarly, a change in the scheduling policy of slice 2 at t4, from proportional fair to class-based only a ects the performance of the UEs in that slice, having no e ect for slice 1 (re ecting functional isolation).

ird, it can internally facilitate e cient use of the spectrum pool via a suitable allocation algorithm that considers the slices’ SLAs and current state as well as the underlying physical conditions.
is exible allocation of radio resources to slices can lead to an improved performance compared to a static allocation mechanism, as illustrated in the example of Fig. 3 (slice 2 borrowing the unused resources of slice 1). Finally, from a UE perspective, the whole slicing operation is transparent with each slice appearing as a di erent MVNO like in RAN sharing.

2.3 Implementation
Following the aforementioned design, we developed a prototype implementation of Orion considering LTE as the supported RAT, providing full support for the virtualization of downlink radio resources. e Orion Hypervisor was implemented completely from scratch in C. For the separation of the control and the data plane required by Orion, we leveraged the API and controller of the publicly available FlexRAN platform [1], which is based on the well known open-source LTE so ware implementation of OpenAirInterface (OAI).
3 DEMONSTRATION
e demonstration of Orion has three main goals: • To show how the Orion architecture accommodates the dynamic
creation of RAN slices sharing the underlying common radio hardware and spectrum, while providing functional and performance isolation among the co-located tenants (MVNOs and verticals). • To highlight the e ciency and exibility of Orion’s mechanisms in distributing the available radio resources among slices based on the service requirements and corresponding SLAs of the la er. • To show how Orion can be integrated into an end-to-end network slicing architecture composed of virtualized RAN and core network functions and how the con guration of the slices and the placement of the virtual functions composing the network can impact the characteristics of the provided service. For the rst and the second part of this demonstration, we will use the testbed setup illustrated in Fig. 4, including three commercial LTE smartphones (LG and Samsung), 3 Intel-based mini PCs (Intel i7 at 3.4GHz and 8GB RAM) and 1 E us USRP B210 RF front-end. e USRP is connected to one of the PCs, over which the eNodeB data plane and the Orion Hypervisor is deployed. e Hypervisor communicates through an Ethernet connection with a compute node that is used for the deployment of the virtual control planes (RAN controllers) of three RAN slices. e controllers are deployed in the form of virtual network functions, running in isolation by employing Docker containers. e Hypervisor also communicates with the third PC, which acts as an EPC (MME and SP-GW) and HSS shared among all three RAN slices.

Figure 5: End-to-end Orion demonstration setup with local and remote core network
rough this setup, we demonstrate the capability of Orion to create RAN slices on-the- y through a simple set of tools and con-
guration les. We show how each UE can be mapped dynamically to a slice through Orion during its a achment process, based on the con guration provided by the slice owner. Moreover, we show the functional and performance isolation that Orion enables, by using di erent downlink scheduling functions with di erent radio resource allocation policies on each of the slices’ RAN controllers, streaming video ows and observing how the introduction of new slices leaves the performance of other co-located slices completely una ected. Finally, we demonstrate the exibility of sharing the available spectrum among slices in an e cient way, by creating slices with services di ering in their requirements for radio resources (some slices asking a xed number of radio resource blocks and others specifying throughput guarantees in ideal conditions) and by showing how the unused radio resources of one slice can be dynamically assigned to other slices running over the same physical base station to improve their performance.
For the nal goal of this demonstration, the testbed is slightly modi ed (Fig. 5) so that, instead of having a shared core for all slices, two EPCs are connected with the eNodeB, each associated with a di erent slice. One EPC is co-located with the base station at the demonstration site (direct Ethernet connection), while the other is deployed in a remote location. Based on this setup, we show how the various EPC components can be deployed as virtual network functions in di erent physical locations (at the network edge or in a central cloud) and how they interact with the RAN slices of Orion to create an end-to-end network slicing se ing. Additionally, we show how the placement of these virtual functions and the radio resource allocation policies used by the Orion Hypervisor can a ect the service provided by the slices, using latency of the slices’ tra c as a concrete example.
