Abstract—To meet diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements in ﬁfth generation (5G) wireless networks, network slicing is proposed as a cost-efﬁcient way to allow operators to provide customized services. On the other hand, fog radio access network (F-RAN) has emerged as a promising network architecture to satisfy different QoS requirements in distinct application scenarios. To make the network slicing work more efﬁciently, a downlink F-RAN, equipped with a ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) slice and an enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) slice logically, is concerned in this paper. A delayaware resource allocation optimization problem is formulated, aiming to maximize the throughput of the eMBB slice as well as guarantee the queuing delay performance of the URLLC slice. The delay-aware optimization problem is reformulated as a perslot joint resource block (RB) and power allocation problem, which is addressed by Lagrange dual decomposition method. Simulation results show a tradeoff between the throughput and the queuing delay of eMBB slice can be achieved while satisfying the delay constraint of URLLC slice.
I. INTRODUCTION
In order to satisfy diverse QoS requirements of different applications in ﬁfth generation (5G) wireless networks, network slicing has been proposed as a cost-efﬁcient way to allow operators to provide customized services. For network slicing [1], the physical network is divided into multiple logically independent networks as network slices, and each slice has its corresponding network functions and radio access technique. Meanwhile, fog radio access networks (F-RAN) [2] has emerged as a promising network architecture that be adaptive to distinct application scenarios [3]. Furthermore, traditional core network (CN)-based network slicing cannot fully exploit the potential of F-RAN, investigation of network slicing in F-RAN is necessary.
Radio resource management (RRM) is critical to the performance of network slicing, and many recent works have investigated the resource management in network slicing. In [4], a joint admission control and resource optimization algorithm was proposed to maximize the sum rate of a singlecell wireless virtualized network (WVN) while satisfying the minimum rate constraint of rate-based slices and the minimum power and sub-carriers constraint of resource-based slices. In [5], a distributed algorithm was proposed to maximize the revenue earned by mobile virtual network operator under satisfying users’ minimum rate requirement and backhaul link constraint. Considering the ever-growing demand of QoS

requirement of latency and reliability imposed by the URLLC communications, delay-aware resource optimization has been studied in works [6] and [7]. In [6], the joint optimization of power allocation and content matching is investigated for wireless content caching networks to maximize the transmission success probability which implies the reliability of networks. A stochastic optimization problem is studied in [7] to maximize the overall throughput of C-RANs with deviceto-device communications.
Due to the fact that there are very few solutions considering different QoS requirements of slices in multi-types application scenario, in this paper we propose a joint resource block (RB) and power allocation scheme which considers not only the channel state information (CSI) but also the queue state information and different application speciﬁc QoS requirements. We formulate a joint RB and power allocation problem in the downlink of F-RANs with URLLC user’s data queue length probabilistic reliability constraints, RB assignment and power allocation constraints to maximize the throughput of eMBB slice as well as satisfy the latency and reliability requirement of URLLC slice. With Lyapunov optimization framework, the primal mixed integer non-linear programming problem is transformed and then addressed by Lagrange dual decomposition method. Simulations results show that the proposed resource allocation algorithm which has taken into account the interference in URLLC slice can achieve a tradeoff between the throughput and the queueing delay of eMBB slice while satisfying the delay performance requirement of URLLC slice.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the system model and formulates optimization problem. In section III, the primal problem is transformed and solved. The simulation results and analysis are given in Section IV, followed by the conclusion in Section V.
II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION
A. System Model
As shown in Fig. 1, a downlink F-RAN system consisting of one eMBB slice and one URLLC slice is investigated. The former provides enhanced mobile broadband services while the latter caters to ultra-reliable and low latency services. The eMBB slice is conﬁgured with N single-antenna RRHs, each user of which is served by all RRHs with global mode. The URLLC slice is consisted of D D2D pairs and one gNodeB (gNB) with cached content serving M user equipments (UEs).

Fig. 1. Downlink F-RANs with two network slices for different services

where gdmk denotes the CSI on RB k from the transmitter of D2D pair d to the GUE m, and gdk denotes the CSI on RB k from gNB to the receiver of D2D pair d. Therefore the downlink transmission rate for RUE j, GUE m, and the receiver of D2D pair d can be given by

The UEs served by RRHs are denoted by RUEs, the UEs served by gNB are labeled as GUEs, and UEs operating on D2D model are labeled by DUEs. Let N = {1, 2, ..., N } represent the set of RRHs, and J = {1, 2, ..., J} denote the set of RUEs. Let M = {1, 2, ..., M } denote the set of GUEs, and D = {1, 2, ..., D} denote the set of D2D pairs. The bandwidth of each RB is denoted by W0, and the entire system bandwidth is W . The RBs assigned to different slices are orthogonal, therefore it is inter-slice interference-free between eMBB slice and URLLC slice. Specially, the RBs assigned to different RUEs in eMBB slice are orthogonal, while the RBs in URLLC slice are reused by one GUE and one D2D pair in URLLC slice, therefore it is intra-tier interference-free in eMBB slice and there is inter-tier interference in URLLC slice. Note that the additive white Gaussian noise is distributed as CN (0, σ2).

The network operates in slotted time t ∈ {1, 2, ..., T } with
length of each time slot denoted by τ = 1. Let hijk , gmk , gddk denote the CSI on RB k from RRH i to RUE j, the gNB to GUE m and the transmitter to the receiver in D2D pair d. Let pRijk represent the transmit power from RRH i to RUE j on RB k , pGmk denote the transmit power from the gNB to GUE m on RB k, and pDdk the transmit power from transmitter to receiver in D2D pair d on RB k. In addition,
the binary variables ajk, amk and adk represent the allocation of RB k to RUE j, the allocation of RB k to GUE m, and to
D2D pair d, which satisfy the following constraints for all k
and t:

where ϕ (x) = 1, if x > 0 and ϕ (x) = 0, if x = 0. The inter-tier interference on RB k from the transmitters of D2D pairs to GUE m in URLLC slice is denoted by Imk, and interference on RB k from GUEs to the receiver of D2D pair d is expressed as Idk, which can be given by

For simpliﬁcation, in (7) and (8), we replace the inter-tier
interference term in the denominator of logarithmic expression of rate with the maximum interference IdDkmax that the receiver of D2D pair d can tolerlate on RB k and the maximum interference ImGkmax that GUE m can tolerlate on RB k, which satisfy the following constraints:

Denote buffering queue length of RUE j, GUE m, and the transmitter of D2D pair d as QRj (t), QGm(t), and QDd (t) respectively. Let ARj (t), AGm(t) and ADd (t) represent the trafﬁc arrival of RUE j, GUE m, the transmitter of D2D pair d at slot t. The evolutions of QRj (t), QGm(t), and QDd (t) are given by

QRj (t + 1) = QRj (t) − RjR (t) + + ARj (t) ,

(14)

QGm (t + 1) = QGm (t) − Rm G (t) + + AGm (t) ,

(15)

QDd (t + 1) = QDd (t) − RdD (t) + + ADd (t) ,

(16)

where {x}+ =∆ max{x, 0}. According to Little’s theorem [9],
the average delay is proportional to the average queue length.
Note that the violation of queue length bound can be regarded
as a destruction to reliability, thus a probabilistic constraint of queue length is imposed on each GUE m and each D2D pair d, i.e., Pr(QGm(t) ≥ Lm) ≤ ξm, and Pr(QDd (t) ≥ Ld) ≤ ξd. Lm and Ld are the allowable maximum queue lengths of GUE m and D2D pair d, while the tolerance values ξm and ξd represent reliability.

III. RESOURCE BLOCK AND POWER ALLOCATION
The optimization problem has a probabilistic constraint C10, which is untractable to solve. To handle the constraint, the Markov’s inequality [10] is used to transform C10 such that Pr{QGm(t) ≥ Lm} ≤ E{QGm(t)}/Lm. Then C10 is satisﬁed if

(18) and (19) will be satisﬁed if the constructed virtual queues are mean-rate stable, whose evolutions are given by

B. Problem Formulation
Let p = [pijk (t) , pmk (t) , pdk (t) : i ∈ N , j ∈ J , m ∈ M, d ∈ D, k ∈ K] and a = [ajk (t) , amk (t) , adk (t) : j ∈ J , m ∈ M, d ∈ D, k ∈ K] denote the vectors of power allocation and RB assignment respectively. The optimization objective is to maximize the time-average throughput of eMBB slice while satisfying the delay constraints of URLLC slice. With the consideration of RB and power allocation constraints, the stochastic optimization problem is formulated as

Constraint C1 ensures that each RB can be assigned to no more than one user of the same type, while C2 ensures that each RB assigned to URLLC slice is reused by one GUE and one D2D pair. C3 ensures that each RB cannot be assigned to more than one slice. C4 and C5 restrict the maximum tolerable interference level of the receiver of D2D pair d and GUE m on RB k if RB k is assigned to D2D pair d and GUE m respectively. C6-C8 restrict the transmit power of RRHs, gNB and transmitters of D2D pairs. C9 is the queue stability constraint for RUEs, C10 is the probabilistic constraint on queue length of GUEs and transmitters of D2D pairs. Note that the problem in (17) is a mixed integer programming problem which is non-convex and NP-hard in general.

With the deﬁnitions of different queues, Θ (t) = QR (t) , FG (t) , FD (t) represents the combined matrix of partial actual queues and all virtual queues, where QR (t) = QRj (t) |j ∈ J , FG (t) = FmG (t) |m ∈ M and FD (t) = FdD (t) |d ∈ D . The Lyapunov function is deﬁned as

To derive the optimal primal solution, we compute the dual variables iteratively with the subgradient method. Due to space restrictions, the expressions of the subgradient of the dual function and the expressions for updating the dual variables

A downlink system of F-RANs conﬁgured with two slices is
considered in simulations. The eMBB slice is conﬁgured with
two single-antenna RRHs and 5 RUEs, while the URLLC slice
is consist of 3 D2D pairs and one gNB serving 3 GUEs. The
number of RBs is K = 20 and the bandwidth of each RB is W0 = 15 kHz. We set piR max = 26 dBm, pgG max = 30 dBm, and pdD max = 23 dBm. The noise power spectrum density σ2 is −174 dBm. we assume the trafﬁc arrivals of
RUEs, GUEs and the transmitter of D2D pairs to be constant
in each time slots without loss of generality. The mean trafﬁc arrival rates are given by A¯Rj = 1.0 bit/slot/Hz, A¯Gm = 0.6 bit/slot/Hz and A¯Dd = 0.4 bit/slot/Hz. We set the allowable maximum queue length Lm = 8.8 bit, Ld = 6.6 bit and the tolerance maximum probability that queue length exceeds
allowable maximum queue ξm = 0.1, ξd = 0.1. In Fig. 2, we evaluate the average queue length of RUE
over 500 time slots. It is shown that the queue length of

RUE grows with t and then ﬂoats within a certain range. Therefore, the queue stability constraint of RUE is satisﬁed. In addition, we evaluate stable queue lengths of RUE under different values of control parameter V . It is obvious that a larger V will lead to worse delay performance because of the fact that more emphasis is put on throughput of eMBB slice instead of queue length minimization. Moreover, by analyzing simulation results, the probability that queue lengths of GUE and DUE exceed the given allowable maximum queue lengths Lm, Ld are 0.17% and 0.13% respectively under the given control parameter V = 100, which is smaller than ξm and ξd. Thus, the delay performance requirement of URLLC slice is satisﬁed.

throughput in eMBB slice because a larger V emphasizes more on the latter. For the same V , larger allowable maximum queue lengths of GUE and DUE lead to a better throughput performance because less RBs needed to be allocated to URLLC slice due to looser delay performance requirement of URLLC slice. Combining Fig.3 and Fig.4, it is clearly that there exists a tradeoff between the throughput and queuing delay of eMBB slice with a control parameter V for adjustment.
V. CONCLUSION
This paper has focused on a delay-aware resource allocation problem for enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultrareliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) slices in the downlink of fog radio access networks (F-RAN). The optimization problem aimed to maximize the throughput of the eMBB slice as well as guarantee the queuing delay performance of the URLLC slice. The primal optimization problem was transformed with Lyapunov optimization framework and then addressed by Lagrange dual decomposition method. Simulation results showed that the proposed resource allocation algorithm attained a tradeoff between the throughput and queueing delay of eMBB slice with the probability that user queue length of URLLC slice exceeds the allowable maximum value under given threshold.
