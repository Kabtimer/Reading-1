Deployment in rural areas no high building L
q Expected range: about 2-4kms q 1-hop connectivity to gateway is difficult to
achieve in real-world, remote, rural scenarios
19

2-hop long-range approach
q smart, transparent relay node should be able to be inserted at anytime between end-devices and gateway to increase range

End-device
q 2 approaches
q Use short Channel Activity Detection (CAD) to dynamically detect uplink messages (draft from Semtech)
q Use observation phase to determine device's schedule
20

LoRa's Channel Activity Detection

q CAD reliability decreases as distance increases

q A CAD returning false does not mean that there is no activity!

q However, during a long transmission (i.e. several

seconds) there is usually at least one CAD

returning true

But ad-hoc mechanism is

needed

Channel Activity Detection (CAD)

Observation phase approach
q On-the-fly learning of incoming traffic from enddevices: observation phase
q Just-in-time wake up in data forwarding phase q Continuous re-synchronization➔only 500ms of
guard time is sufficient q No additional hardware ➔ sensor nodes can be
recycled as relay q Advanced features
q Insertion of new isolated end-devices q Handling downlink messages q Similarity detection between devices
